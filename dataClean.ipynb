A number of key initiatives gathered momentum in the year and the Group is now more effectively leveraging scale and developing an improved customer proposition across all banners and markets.Operating performance Sales of US$10.3 billion for the year by the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s subsidiaries were 8% behind those of 2019. Total sales, including 100% of associates and joint ventures, were 2% higher at US$28.2 billion, primarily due to a higher sales contribution from Yonghui.The Groupâ\\x80\\x99s subsidiaries saw underlying operating profit of US$412 million, 6% behind the previous year. Strong growth in operating profit for Grocery Retail and IKEA was offset by a reduction in profit for the Health and Beauty and Convenience businesses. Among the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s subsidiaries, disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has had the greatest impact on our Health and Beauty business in Hong Kong.Underlying profit attributable to shareholders was US$276 million, down 14% from US$321 million last year.

There was strong profit growth across both North Asia and Southeast Asia, driven by benefits accrued from implementing improvement programmes, strong like-for-like sales and government subsidies. Performance in Indonesia, however, was negatively impacted by significant government restrictions on movement, which affected traffic into hypermarkets.Total Grocery Retail sales increased by 3% to US$5.3 billion.

Operating profit decreased by 31% to US$57 million, driven primarily by a combination of the shortfall in sales and a sales mix shift towards lower product margin categories.Health and BeautyTotal sales for the Health and Beauty Division reduced by 35% to US$2.0 billion as the pandemic impacted customer traffic across our key markets. In North Asia, enforced border closures have led to a virtual elimination of tourism, most notably from the Chinese mainland, which has significantly impacted our Mannings business in Hong Kong and Macau. The resultant decline in sales performance was the primary cause of a significant decrease in operating profit from US$296 million in 2019 to US$66 million.Faced with challenging trading conditions, the Group is focusing on ensuring that its customer value proposition â\\x80\\x93 from the perspective of pricing, stores and channel to market - remains relevant and competitive. Price investment campaigns have been introduced across our key markets with encouraging results so far. The Group is also managing costs appropriately.Home FurnishingsIn Home Furnishings, sales for IKEA increased by 9% in the year, as new store openings and strong e-commerce growth offset pandemic related disruption. Operating profit increased by US$28 million to US$71 million, due to a combination of new store profit contribution, lower cost of goods, strong cost controls, reduced pre-opening expenses for new stores and government support.8 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020AssociatesThe contribution from 50%-owned Maximâ\\x80\\x99s declined to US$36 million, from US$82 million in the prior year, as the pandemic, government-imposed restrictions on movement and social distancing measures caused a significant reduction to customer visits to restaurants, as well as leading to some temporary closures.The Groupâ\\x80\\x99s share of underlying results in Yonghui grew from US$23 million in 2019 to US$29 million in 2020, primarily due to strong sales growth. Dairy Farmâ\\x80\\x99s share of underlying results in Robinsons Retail fell by 5% to US$14 million. The financial performance of Robinsons Retail in the year was impacted by government restrictions on movement due to the pandemic, particularly with respect to its discretionary formats.Transformation During the year, the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s transformation gathered momentum with the completion of a number of key initiatives.Dairy Farm is accelerating the pace of its digital change to adapt to the rapidly changing environment.The launch of Yuu Rewards in July 2020 represented a critical milestone in driving Dairy Farmâ\\x80\\x99s modernisation and digital transformation. Yuu will support a more customer-centric approach across all the Dairy Farm banners and drive an enhanced level of customer engagement.There has also been continuing investment in e-commerce, especially in the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s Home Furnishings and Health and Beauty businesses, and the Group is treating this area as a strategic priority. The Group is also investing significantly in existing legacy IT systems to improve the digitisation of in-store operations.'},\n",

The Group has had to constantly adapt the management of its operations against a backdrop of varying levels of community infection rates and rapidly evolving customer behaviours. This was done in the context of different and changing approaches to managing the pandemic by governments in the regions where we operate, as well as the need to invest in and ensure our team membersâ\\x80\\x99 safety and well-being.Despite these challenges, the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s transformation plan executed over the past three years has supported our ability to adapt to the ever-changing environment. In addition, the diversity of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s business mix from the perspective of both direct and indirectly managed businesses, formats and geographies has provided effective insulation from unprecedented trading conditions.Underlying operating profit for the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s subsidiaries reduced by 6% in the year, with strong profit growth in Grocery Retail and Home Furnishings offset by reduced profitability in Convenience Stores and Health and Beauty. The contribution from key associates decreased materially, primarily due to lower profitability from Maximâ\\x80\\x99s (where we own 50%), which was significantly impacted by disruption caused by COVID-19. Total underlying net profit for the Group reduced by 14% to US$276 million.10 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020Five strategic imperatives 1) Growth in China 7-Eleven South China opened over 200 additional new stores during the year despite the challenges of movement restrictions. Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s extremely tight lockdown regime significantly impacted foot traffic in the early part of the year, with up to 500 stores having to close for prolonged periods. Subsequently, when movement restrictions became less severe, regulations prohibiting the sale of Ready-to-Eat products impacted sales recovery. Despite the challenges posed by trading conditions, strong execution of product innovation and promotions led to a significant improvement in sales in the second half of the year. During the year, 7-Eleven South China began a project to transform its legacy IT systems with a new end-to-end agile IT solution, to support both an improved customer shopping experience and its future growth ambitions.Mannings Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s sales performance was impacted significantly in the first quarter as restrictions on movement led to reduced traffic. However, the business reported improving like-for-like sales trends throughout 2020. Mannings China continues to execute its space optimisation plan with greater focus around the Greater Bay Area, where Mannings has stronger brand awareness and can leverage the existing scale of 7-Eleven. E-commerce growth continues to be strong, with penetration now over double digits.'},\n",

The virtual elimination of tourist traffic through border closures has had a significant impact on Manningsâ\\x80\\x99 sales and profitability, and the business has focused strongly on investment in value to maximise appeal to the Hong Kong customers. Performance has been encouraging so far, with the price initiative underpinning relative improvement in both volume and profitability. 7-Elevenâ\\x80\\x99s performance was also adversely impacted by reduced local foot traffic, particularly in MTR locations following business and government advice to encourage employees to work from home.Wellcome Hong Kong reported double-digit like-for-like sales growth in 2020, driven by a trend towards eating-at-home, greater focus on fresh quality, strong in-store execution and enhanced pricing.

The programme links more than ten household brand names, including affiliate partners such as Hang Seng Bank and other businesses in the wider Jardine Matheson Group such as Pizza Hut and KFC, across over 2,000 locations in Hong Kong. For the first time, a CRM programme is allowing Dairy Farm to leverage the scale of all its banners in Hong Kong. The programme is both an important pillar supporting digital transformation within Dairy Farm and a means of maintaining Dairy Farmâ\\x80\\x99s strength in Hong Kong.3) Revitalising Southeast AsiaProfitability in the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s Southeast Asian Grocery Retail business improved significantly in the year, due to a combination of the initiatives implemented as part of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s multi-year transformation programme and strong like-for-like sales growth.Despite delays caused by COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, the team successfully relaunched all Giant Singapore stores in 2020. This programme involved detailed research, combined with in-depth sales and merchandise analysis, a detailed plan to reapportion space, and investment in new equipment where required. All stores have now either been refreshed or refitted with a major brand facelift and space reallocation. There has also been a significant shift in emphasis onto Own Brand within Giant stores, and results have been encouraging. The repositioning of the Giant brand has been underpinned by a programme to re-establish price trust and to invest in lower prices on hundreds of frequently purchased items across fresh, grocery and chilled categories. Strong marketing execution was also implemented to support the brand repositioning. Whilst still early, these steps have led to an improved sales performance, with underlying like-for-like sales growing at their strongest rate since 2013.12 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020Performance of our upscale Grocery Retail stores continues to show good progress. Improvements in range, availability and freshness are supporting improved sales performance. In addition, our new concept pilot stores, with much stronger emphasis on fresh food, international products, organic, health and wellness ranges, have performed very strongly. New concept stores have now been introduced in Malaysia and Singapore, in addition to those introduced in Hong Kong.Our Guardian Health and Beauty business remains a significant growth opportunity for the Group. However, like-for-like sales performance and profitability have been impacted by government restrictions on movement in each of the markets in which we operate. Despite the challenging environment, the team continues to focus on improving key areas of the business, including product range, value, store and sales channel development. Guardian Singapore relaunched its e-commerce platform in February, which supported around 40% growth in the year. In addition, new shop-in-shop concepts were executed in over 50 Giant stores in 2020. Guardian Malaysia reported triple-digit e-commerce growth in the year. Across our key geographies in Southeast Asia, localised versions of price reinvestment campaigns were also launched to enhance Guardianâ\\x80\\x99s customer offering. New health and beauty concept stores have also been developed and will be rolled out in a disciplined manner in 2021. Within Guardian Health and Beauty, growth in Own Brand is an area of focus, with the team working on a number of initiatives to create scale and differentiation. In 2020, one highlight in this area was the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s new partnership with CP All to roll out Guardian products into around 12,000 7-Eleven stores across Thailand.'},\n",

However, its financial performance was impacted by restrictions on movement caused by COVID-19, particularly with respect to its discretionary retail businesses. In October, Dairy Farm deepened its partnership with Robinsons Retail by combining its interests in Rose Pharmacy with Robinsons Retailâ\\x80\\x99s subsidiary Southstar Drug. The combination creates a leading pharmacy chain in the Philippines. The combined business will support greater competitiveness, create synergies and allow both Dairy Farm and Robinsons Retail to leverage scale.4) Building capability The Group has balanced internal promotions with the introduction of external capability, and the change in leadership within the organisation has brought depth of experience and thinking to Dairy Farm. It has also led to a cultural shift within the Group in terms of our ways of working. In turn, this has supported the resilience of the business and our ability to adapt to rapidly evolving challenges posed by the pandemic, including different and changing approaches by governments in each of the regions in which we operate. Decisive action was taken to ensure joint co-ordination of: resourcing to support fluctuations in trading hours; inventory procurement to ensure stability of supply; supply of health and hygiene products for all team members; and clear, regular, consistent communications updates to all team members. One outcome of strong execution in this area has been that Dairy Farm has been at the forefront of ensuring our peopleâ\\x80\\x99s safety.As we move to the next phase of our transformation, we are seeking to nurture talent from within through the development of our own graduate recruitment programmes and through close co-operation with the wider Jardine Matheson Group.Our focus on building capability has not been limited to management positions above store level. We have also invested in our systems and processes to enhance our team membersâ\\x80\\x99 skills on the shop floor in an agile manner. In 2020, we rolled out a new software system to train team members through mobile devices, which enables easy access to training on the shop floor and on the job. Now accessible to over 50,000 team members across the Group, the system also enabled the training of 22,000 team members within three weeks to support the successful and smooth rollout of the Yuu Rewards programme.5) Driving digital innovationDairy Farm is accelerating the pace of its digital change to adapt to the rapidly changing environment.The Yuu Rewards programme launched in July has been highly successful and total membership has now reached over three million. In 2020, the Yuu Rewards app was the most downloaded app on the Apple appstore in Hong Kong. Over 50 billion points have been earned, highlighting a high level of member engagement. We believe this is just the beginning, and we are excited to begin a deeper and more meaningful dialogue with our customers.It has been well documented that the spread of the pandemic has led to a global surge in e-commerce growth. Strong online sales growth has supported our Home Furnishings business, with e-commerce penetration over 10% in 2020. We have also invested in infrastructure supporting e-commerce for Health and Beauty in Mannings businesses in both Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, as well as cross-border e-commerce and Guardian in Southeast Asia. An all-new Marketplace app was also launched in 2020, with enhanced service capability to support fulfilment. E-commerce has been an area where Dairy Farm has historically lagged. However, the Group is now treating this area as a strategic priority.13'},\n",

While lockdowns, social distancing and stay at home orders have been in place, our businesses across the regions have generally been regarded as essential services and remained open. Our team members are therefore placing themselves at risk every day and the Group continues investing significantly in a number of initiatives to ensure the health, safety and well-being of each team member.Recognising the hardship faced by all members of the community during these challenging times, we responded by providing increased support to the communities that we serve.

In addition, we have introduced price investment programmes across our banners and geographies to drive value for customers.In total, the Group has made over US$50 million of direct investments in supporting the health, safety and well-being of our team members as well as in supporting our communities as a result of COVID-19 in 2020. The Group will continue to invest to support our team members and community given the gravity of the impact of the pandemic.I would also like to express my deep gratitude for the continuing dedication and resolve of team members in putting customers first during these difficult times.Year ahead Undoubtedly, 2020 was a challenging year. The extent and duration of the impact of the pandemic in 2021 remains unclear, and this year is likely to remain challenging. Despite the short-term impact from the pandemic, however, our team members remain motivated, determined and resolute in the continued execution of the Dairy Farm multi-year transformation plan. We are halfway through that plan and there is much still to do. Despite all adverse external influences, the transformation plan remains on track. While financial results do not yet reflect the efforts made to date, we are confident that the actions being taken remain the right ones and the Company is in a far better shape now to face the challenges of the market going forward.I would like to thank my Leadership Team, their teams and every team member in our stores who have worked tirelessly for Dairy Farm over the last three years to get us this far. Our store teams do deserve a special mention. In every country where lockdowns were put in place and populations were encouraged and even mandated to stay home for their safety, our store and supply chain teams turned up to do their jobs in genuinely dangerous circumstances.

We are also aware that as a large company operating in many countries, we have a responsibility to recognise the increasing needs of the communities we serve and look for ways in which we can make contributions to help them. We want to help both our customers and our team members (People), we want to help improve our supply chain by reducing food waste, lowering plastic usage and sourcing ethically (Products). We want to improve energy efficiency, recognising growing concerns over climate change (Planet) and we wish to strengthen partnerships with like-minded organisations who also wish to make a sustainable difference.We would be the first to accept that all organisations can do more in the area of corporate and social responsibility, and we are no exception. We are building greater focus on where we can begin to make a difference and demonstrate measured progress over time. Below are some examples of the early progress we believe we are making:PeopleHelping customers, their communities and our team members We are greatly appreciative of the service our team members provide to our customers on the front-line day in and day out, therefore making them feel safe is our number one priority. We have invested heavily in providing over 440,000 pieces of personal protective equipment (masks, hand sanitisers and goggles) for our team members to ensure they are protected and feel safe when serving customers amidst the pandemic.In a year like no other, we prioritised helping our communities. We were the first retailer in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Indonesia to implement priority shopping hours in our supermarkets for the most vulnerable members of our communities, ensuring they can shop safely, secure in the knowledge that we are putting their health and wellbeing first. Mannings Hong Kong was16 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020also the first Hong Kong retailer to take on a community pharmacy role. We launched a medication collection service in our Mannings stores, thereby reducing hospital footfall and the associated risk of infection.With demand increasing significantly at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we needed to quickly bring additional help onboard to better serve our customers. Based on these needs, we saw an opportunity in Singapore to support other affected industries by offering recruitment opportunities to their teams. We first started the initiative with Fairmont Singapore, then the Food Drinks Allied Workersâ\\x80\\x99 Union (FDAWU) came onboard in support of our efforts and expanded the outreach to more hotel partners, such as the Four Seasons and other international hotel chains. Through this initiative, we provided support to those in the tourism and hospitality industry who have been impacted by COVID-19. We also donated care packs to those in need within our communities.We place huge significance on access to education for all, which meant stepping up when the pandemic forced school closures in Indonesia.

Together with HSI, we are working to drive long-term change in the supply chain. As part of this, we will be launching a new value range of cage-free eggs under our Meadows Brand in Hong Kong and Singapore in 2021, whilst introducing cage-free eggs into all ten of our IKEA restaurants in 2021 in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Through this programme, we have reduced food waste by nearly 10,000 tonnes in the last two years across our markets.Donating food offers a further opportunity to minimise food waste in our stores, whilst having a positive effect on the welfare of those in need within our communities. For example in Malaysia, Giant collaborated with The Lost Food Project to ensure food is not wasted but delivered to those who need it most. In total, the partnership saw RM50,000 worth of food supplies donated through 26 charity organisations across Klang Valley and Negeri Sembilan. PT Hero partnered with Taman Safari Indonesia to donate fresh produce to animals in conservation. With COVID-19 putting an intense strain on business for zoos and aquariums, this partnership demonstrates a forward-thinking scheme to meet two distinct needs with one fantastic solution. In Singapore, the installation of a food waste management machine, known as an ecoDigester, enables the conversion of organic waste into water for washing. In Hong Kong, our collaboration with O Â· Park allows us to divert organic waste for conversion into biogas and compost. Moreover, Giant are currently trialling a new composting method with our NGO partner in Indonesia, where larvae decompose food waste into organic fertiliser. We endeavour to roll out similar sustainable technologies in other markets and work towards developing a circular economy within our operations. 17'},\n",

The strong like-for-like sales performance was driven by a combination of a shift in customer behaviour towards eating-at-home and operational improvements to our range, quality and pricing. Operating profit increased from US$63 million to US$267 million, primarily driven by strong sales performance and cost benefits from our improvement programmes.Sales in Hong Kong and Macau were significantly ahead of the prior year, with strong double-digit like-for-like sales growth. Reported profitability was supported by strong sales growth, the ongoing execution of improvement programmes as well as government subsidies.Our price reinvestment campaign in Taiwan, as well as changing customer behaviours, supported strong sales growth for Wellcome Taiwan. During the year, the Group announced that it had entered into an agreement with Carrefour for them to acquire 100% of Wellcome Taiwan.Double-digit like-for-like sales growth drives strength in Grocery Retail performance.23'},\n",

The unfavourable movement in working capital in the year was due principally to investments to maintain availability during the early part of the pandemic, inventory stockpiling as a result of government policies in Singapore, settlement of supplier purchase obligations with respect to an earlier 2020 Chinese New Year as well as lower sales churn in the Health and Beauty business. Normal capital expenditure was lower at US$248 million versus US$305 million in 2019 due principally to tighter control on new store expansions and refurbishment of the existing store estate.

Balance sheet Total assets, excluding cash and bank balances, of US$7.6 billion were broadly in line with 2019. Inventory was down by 13% to US$779 million, reflecting the continuous effort to manage inventory and clear poor-quality stocks. Net operating assets were US$1.3 billion at the end of 2020, an 8% increase versus the previous year.The Group ended the year with net debt of US$817 million, broadly in line with last yearâ\\x80\\x99s level. Dividend The Board is recommending a final dividend of USÂ¢11.50 per share, giving a total dividend of USÂ¢16.50 per share for the year, a 21% reduction compared with 2019. Financing The Group, excluding associates and joint ventures, had gross debt of US$1,094 million at 31st December 2020, a drop of US$28 million from 2019. The gross debt is funded by total committed and uncommitted lines of US$3,091 million. At the end of 2020, US$1,319 million of committed and US$676 million of uncommitted facilities were unused and available. The Group had cash balances of US$278 million at 31st December 2020. The Group has implemented a global liquidity cash pooling scheme which enables the Group to manage and optimise its working capital funding requirements daily. The available undrawn committed facilities and the cash pooling scheme provide good support and flexibility to the Group for the cash in need for the operation. The Directors believe that the Group has strong liquidity to run the business during the pandemic and beyond.Where required, and typically for working capital purposes, borrowings are normally taken out in local currencies by the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s operating subsidiaries to fund daily operations. Borrowings to fund any strategic expansion of the Group are managed centrally and typically funded in United States dollars and Hong Kong dollars, with hedging of foreign exchange and interest rate risk as may be appropriate depending on the investment. Financial risk management A comprehensive discussion of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s financial risk management policies is included in note 38 to the financial statements. The Group manages its exposure to financial risk using a variety of techniques and instruments. The main objectives are to limit exchange and interest rate risks and to provide a degree of certainty about costs. It is our policy not to engage in speculative derivative transactions. The investment of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s cash resources is managed to minimise risk while seeking to enhance yield. Overall, the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s funding arrangements are designed to keep an appropriate balance between equity and debt (short and long-term), to maximise flexibility for the future development of the business.

Where the Group is a lessee, the practical expedient is applied to account for the change in lease payments resulting from rent concessions granted as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and elects not to assess these concessions as lease modifications when all of the following conditions are met:(i) the revised lease payments are substantially the same as, or less than, the consideration for the lease immediately preceding the change; (ii) reduction in lease payments relates to payment due on or before 30th June 2021; and (iii) there is no substantive change to the other terms and conditions of the lease.Rent concessions fulfilling the above conditions are recognised in the profit and loss over the period in which they cover.Apart from the above, there are no other amendments which are effective in 2020 and relevant to the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s operations, that have a significant impact on the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s results, financial position and accounting policies.The Group has not early adopted any other standards, interpretations or amendments that have been issued but not yet effective (note 37).The principal operating subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures have different functional currencies in line with the economic environments of the locations in which they operate.

Options are assumed to be exercised at the end of the fifth year following the date of grant. No options were granted in 2019.Prior to the adoption of the LTIP, The Dairy Farm International Share Option Plan 2005 provided selected executives with options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company. The exercise prices of the granted options were, in general, based on the average market prices for the five trading days immediately preceding the dates of grant of the options. Options are normally vested over a period of up to three years and are exercisable for up to ten years following the date of grant.An LTIP was adopted by the Company on 5th March 2015. Under these awards, free shares are received by the participants to the extent the award vests. Conditions, if any, are at the discretion of the Directors. There were no share awards granted in 2020 and 2019.Share-based long-term incentive plans (â\\x80\\x98LTIPâ\\x80\\x99) have been put in place to provide incentives for selected executives. Awards take the form of share options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company with exercise prices based on the then prevailing market prices, however, share awards which will vest free of payment may also be made.

Principal Accounting PoliciesBasis of consolidation (i) The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries, and the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s interests in associates and joint ventures.(ii) A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition includes the fair value at the acquisition date of any contingent consideration. The Group recognises the non-controlling interestâ\\x80\\x99s proportionate share of the recognised identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary. In a business combination achieved in stages, the Group remeasures its previously held interest in the acquiree at its acquisition-date fair value and recognises the resulting gain or loss in profit and loss. Changes in a parentâ\\x80\\x99s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in the loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. When control over a previous subsidiary is lost, any remaining interest in the entity is remeasured at fair value and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit and loss.All material intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised surpluses and deficits on transactions between Group companies have been eliminated.(iii) An associate is an entity, not being a subsidiary or a joint venture, over which the Group exercises significant influence. A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.Associates and joint ventures are included on the equity basis of accounting.Profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are recognised in the consolidated financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investorâ\\x80\\x99s interests in the associates and joint ventures.(iv) Non-controlling interests represent the proportion of the results and net assets of subsidiaries and their associates and joint ventures not attributable to the Group.(v) The results of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are included or excluded from their effective dates of acquisition or disposal, respectively. The results of entities other than subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are included to the extent of dividends received when the right to receive such dividend is established.102Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020'},\n",

Principal Accounting Policies continuedForeign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are accounted for at the exchange rates ruling at the transaction dates.Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, together with all other monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies, are translated into United States dollars at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end. Results expressed in foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars at the average rates of exchange ruling during the year, which approximate the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, and of financial instruments which are designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under exchange reserves. On the disposal of these investments, such exchange differences are recognised in profit and loss. All other exchange differences are recognised in profit and loss.Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition of a foreign entity after 1st January 2003 are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated into United States dollars at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end.Impairment of non-financial assets Assets that have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortisation and are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the assets may be impaired. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is a separately identifiable cash flow. Cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the units may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an assetâ\\x80\\x99s fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment annually.Intangible assets (i) Goodwill represents the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the acquisition-date fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the acquisition-date fair value of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s share of the net identifiable assets acquired. Non-controlling interests are measured at their proportionate share of the net identifiable assets at the acquisition date. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is recognised directly in profit and loss. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of associates and joint ventures is included in investment in associates and joint ventures. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment loss.The profit or loss on disposal of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures is stated after deducting the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.103'},\n",

The Group recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement dates, that is the dates the underlying assets are available for use. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of the right-of-use assets includes amounts of the initial measurement of lease liabilities recognised, lease payments made at or before the commencement dates less any lease incentives received, initial direct costs incurred and restoration costs. Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives and the lease terms.Lease contracts may contain lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract to lease and non-lease component based on their relative stand-alone prices. For property leases where the Group is a lessee, it has elected not to separate lease and immaterial non-lease components and accounts for these items as a single lease component.Leases At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.The profit or loss on disposal of tangible assets is recognised by reference to their carrying amounts.Where the carrying amount of a tangible asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount.Depreciation of tangible assets is calculated on the straight-line basis to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life. The residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date. The estimated useful lives are as follows:Tangible assets and depreciation Freehold properties comprised land and buildings. Freehold land is stated at cost less any impairment. No depreciation is provided on freehold land as it is deemed to have an indefinite life. Buildings on freehold and leasehold land are stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment. Other tangible assets are stated at cost less amounts provided for depreciation and impairment.Intangible assets continued (ii) Other intangible assets, consisting of trademarks and computer software, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Amortisation is calculated on the straight-line basis to allocate the cost of intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Trademarks with indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortisation.36. Principal Accounting Policies continued3 to 7 yearsDairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020'},\n",

Lump sum payments are made upfront to acquire these land interests from their previous registered owners or governments in the jurisdictions where the land is located. There are no ongoing payments to be made under the term of the land leases, other than insignificant lease renewal costs or payments based on rateable value set by the relevant government authorities. These payments are stated at cost and are amortised over the term of the lease which includes the renewal period if the lease can be renewed by the Group without significant cost.Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease terms. Lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. Lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased by the interest costs on the lease liabilities and decreased by lease payments made.The carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured when there is a change in the lease term, or there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or a rate, or there is a change in the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual guarantee, or there is a change arising from the reassessment of whether the Group will be reasonably certain to exercise an extension or a termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets (i.e. US$5,000 or less) and short-term leases. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Lease payments associated with these leases are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit and loss over the lease term.Lease liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities unless payments are due within 12 months from the balance sheet date.105'},\n",

The classification is based on the managementâ\\x80\\x99s business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics.Equity investments are measured at fair value with fair value gains and losses recognised in profit and loss. Transaction costs of investments carried at fair value through profit and loss are expensed in profit and loss.Investments are classified as non-current assets. All purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the investments.Stocks Stocks, which principally comprise goods held for resale, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average cost basis and comprises purchase price less rebates. A stock provision is recognised when the net realisable value from sale of the stock is estimated to be lower than the carrying value.Debtors Trade and other debtors, excluding derivative financial instruments, are measured at amortised cost except where the effect of discounting would be immaterial. Provision for impairment is established by considering potential financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in arriving at operating profit. When a debtor is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amount previously written off are credited to profit and loss.Debtors with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date are classified under non-current assets. Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise deposits with banks, and cash and bank balances, net of bank overdrafts. In the balance sheet, bank overdrafts are included in current borrowings. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has present legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligations, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligations can be made. Obligations arising from restructuring plans are recognised when detailed formal plans have been established and when there is a valid expectation that such plans will be carried out by either starting to implement them or announcing their main features to those affected by it. Borrowings and borrowing costs Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. All borrowing costs are expensed as incurred. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.106Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020'},\n",

Tax is recognised in profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.Provision for deferred tax is made on the revaluation of certain non-current assets and, in relation to acquisitions, on the difference between the fair value of the net assets acquired and their tax bases. Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets relating to the carry forward of unused tax losses are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised.Employee benefits (i) Pension obligations The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans, the assets of which are held in trustee administered funds.Pension accounting costs for defined benefit plans are assessed using the projected unit credit method. Under this method, the costs of providing pensions are charged to profit and loss spreading the regular cost over the service lives of employees in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries, who carry out a full valuation of major plans every year. The pension obligations are measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related liability. Plan assets are measured at fair value.Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur.Past service costs are recognised immediately in profit and loss.The Groupâ\\x80\\x99s total contributions relating to the defined contribution plans are charged to profit and loss in the year to which they relate.107'},\n",

Principal Accounting Policies continuedEmployee benefits continued (ii) Share-based compensation The Company operates a number of equity-settled employee share option schemes. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the share options or the share awards in respect of options or awards granted after 7th November 2002 is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the share options or share awards granted as determined on the grant date. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share options that are expected to become exercisable and the number of share awards which will be vested free of payment. The impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit and loss.Non-current assets and disposal group held for sale Non-current assets and disposal group are classified as held for sale and stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amounts are expected to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Once classified as held for sale, the assets are no longer amortised or depreciated.Derivative financial instruments The Group only enters into derivative financial instruments in order to hedge underlying exposures and not as speculative investments. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair values. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss is dependent on the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability (â\\x80\\x98fair value hedgeâ\\x80\\x99), or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the foreign currency risk on a firm commitment (â\\x80\\x98cash flow hedgeâ\\x80\\x99).At inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items. The Group documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions.Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualified as fair value hedges and that are highly effective, are recognised in profit and loss, along with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging fixed rate borrowings is recognised in profit and loss within finance costs, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged fixed rate borrowings attributable to interest rate risk. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in profit and loss. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the cumulative adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest rate method is used is amortised to profit and loss over the residual period to maturity.108Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020'},\n",

       "  'content': '36. Principal Accounting Policies continued Derivative financial instruments continued Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualified as cash flow hedges and that are highly effective, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under hedging reserves. Changes in the fair value relating to the ineffective portion are recognised immediately in profit and loss. Where the hedged item results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the deferred gains and losses are included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in profit and loss as the hedged item affects profit and loss. Otherwise, amounts deferred in hedging reserves are transferred to profit and loss in the same periods during which the hedged firm commitment or forecasted transaction affects profit and loss. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of the interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in profit and loss within finance cost at the same time as the interest expense on the hedged borrowings. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in hedging reserves at that time remains in the hedging reserves and is recognised in profit and loss when the committed or forecasted transaction occurs. When a committed or forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in hedging reserves is immediately transferred to profit and loss.Certain derivative transactions, while providing effective economic hedges under the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s risk management policies, do not qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules in IFRS 9. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9 are recognised immediately in profit and loss.The fair value of derivatives which are designated and qualified as effective hedges are classified as non-current assets or liabilities if the remaining maturities of the hedged assets or liabilities are greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty.Non-trading items Non-trading items are separately identified to provide greater understanding of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s underlying business performance. Items classified as non-trading items include fair value gains and losses on equity investments which are measured at fair value through profit and loss; gains and losses arising from the sale of businesses, investments and properties; impairment of non-depreciable intangible assets, associates and joint ventures, and other investments; provisions for the closure of businesses; acquisition-related costs in business combinations; and other credits and charges of a non-recurring nature that require inclusion in order to provide additional insight into underlying business performance.109'},\n",

Principal Accounting Policies continuedEarnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated on profit attributable to shareholders and on the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year. The weighted average number excludes the shares held by the Trustee under the Share-based Long-term Incentive Plans. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, profit attributable to shareholders is adjusted for the effects of the conversion of dilutive potential ordinary shares, and the weighted average number of shares is adjusted for the number of shares which are deemed to be issued for no consideration under the share-based long-term incentive plans based on the average share price during the year.Dividends Dividends proposed or declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date.Sales recognition Sales consist of the fair value of goods sold to customers, net of returns, discounts and sales related taxes. These do not include sales generated by associates and joint ventures. Sale of goods is recognised at the point of sale, when the control of the asset is transferred to customers, and is recorded at the net amount received from customers.Buying income Supplier incentives, rebates and discounts are collectively referred to as buying income. Buying income is recognised when earned by the Group, which occurs when all obligations conditional for earning income have been discharged, and the income can be measured reliably based on the terms of the contract.The income is recognised as a credit within cost of sales. Where the income earned relates to stocks which are held by the Group at period ends, the income is included within the cost of those stocks, and recognised in cost of sales upon sale of those stocks. The accrued value at the reporting date is included in trade debtors or trade creditors, depending on the right of offset.The key types of buying income which the Group receives include:â\\x80\\x93 Discounts and incentives relate to individual unit sales. â\\x80\\x93 Sales volume-based incentives based on achieving certain purchases on promotion for an event or a period. â\\x80\\x93 Conditional incentives subject to satisfaction of certain conditions by the Group. â\\x80\\x93 Fixed amounts agreed with suppliers for supporting in-store activity.Government grants Grants from government are recognised at their fair values where there is reasonable assurance that the grants will be received, and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grants.Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the profit and loss as other income on a systematic basis in the period in which the expenses are recognised. Unconditional grants are recognised in the profit and loss as other income when they become receivable.Grants related to assets are deducted in arriving at the carrying value of the related assets.110Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020'},\n",

Standards and Amendments Issued But Not Yet EffectiveA number of amendments effective for accounting periods beginning after 2020 have been published and will be adopted by the Group from their effective dates. The Group is currently assessing the potential impact of these standard and amendments but expects the adoption will not have a significant impact on the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s consolidated financial statements. The more important amendments are set out below.(i) Interest Rate Benchmark Reform â\\x80\\x93 Phase 2: Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 (effective from 1st January 2021) provides practical expedients as a result of the reform which affect the measurement of financial assets, financial liabilities and lease liabilities, and a number of reliefs for hedging relationships. The Group will apply the amendments from 1st January 2021, but it is not expected the adoption will have a significant impact on the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s consolidated financial statements.(ii) Amendment to IFRS 9: â\\x80\\x98Fees in the â\\x80\\x9910 per centâ\\x80\\x99 Test for Derecognition of Financial Liabilitiesâ\\x80\\x99 (effective from 1st January 2022) clarifies the requirement to derecognise the original financial liability and recognise a new financial liability where there is an exchange between an existing borrower and lender of debt instrument with substantially different terms. The amendment clarifies that the terms are substantially different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms using the original effective interest rate, including any fees paid net of any fees received, is at least 10 per cent different from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. The Group will apply the amendment from 1st January 2022, but it is not expected the adoption will have a significant impact on the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s consolidated financial statements.(iii) Amendments to IAS 37: Onerous Contracts â\\x80\\x93 Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (effective from 1st January 2022) clarifies that for the purpose of assessing whether a contract is onerous, the cost of fulfilling the contract includes both the incremental costs of fulfilling that contract and an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts. The Group will apply the amendments from 1st January 2022, but it is not expected the adoption will have a significant impact on the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s consolidated financial statements.111'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Notes to the Financial Statements38. Financial Risk ManagementFinancial risk factors The Groupâ\\x80\\x99s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.The Groupâ\\x80\\x99s treasury function co-ordinates financial risk management policies and their implementation on a group-wide basis. The Groupâ\\x80\\x99s treasury policies are designed to manage the financial impact of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates and to minimise the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s financial risks. The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options as appropriate for hedging transactions and managing the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s assets and liabilities in accordance with the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s financial risk management policies. Financial derivative contracts are executed between third party banks and the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s entity that is directly exposed to the risk being hedged. Hedge accounting is applied to remove the accounting mismatch between the hedging instrument and the hedged item. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is deferred into the cash flow hedge reserve through other comprehensive income and will be recognised in profit and loss when the hedged item affects profit and loss. In general, the volatility in profit or loss can be reduced by applying hedge accounting.Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument.For hedges of foreign currency purchases, the Group enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match exactly with the terms of the hedged item. The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship has been and expected to be effective in offsetting changes in cash flow of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.Ineffectiveness may arise if the timing of the forecast transaction changes from what was originally estimated for hedges of foreign currency purchases, or if there are changes in the credit risk of the Group or the derivative counterparty.The Group enters into interest rate swaps that have similar critical terms as the hedged item, such as reference rate, reset dates, payment dates, maturities and notional amount. The Group does not hedge 100% of its loans, therefore the hedged item is identified as a proportion of the outstanding loans up to the notional amount of the swaps. As all critical terms matched during the year, effective economic relationship existed between the swaps and the loans.Hedge ineffectiveness for interest rate swaps is assessed using the same principles as for hedges of foreign currency purchases. It may occur due to:(i) The credit value/debit value adjustment on the interest rate swaps which is not matched by the loan;(ii) Differences in critical terms between the interest rate swaps and loans; and(iii) The effects of the forthcoming reforms to IBOR, because these might take effect at a different time and have a different impact on the hedged item (the floating-rate debt) and the hedging instrument (the interest rate swap used to hedge the debt).The ineffectiveness during 2020 in relation to interest rate swaps was not material while there was no interest rate swap in 2019.112Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020'},\n",

Financial Risk Management continuedFinancial risk factors continued (i) Market risk Foreign exchange risk Entities within the Group are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, net investments in foreign operations and net monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency that is not the entityâ\\x80\\x99s functional currency.The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options in a consistent manner to hedge firm and anticipated foreign exchange commitments and manage foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions. The purpose of these hedges is to mitigate the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on assets and liabilities and the profit and loss account of the Group.Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of monetary assets and liabilities being denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency. There are no significant monetary balances held by Group companies at 31st December 2020 that are denominated in a non-functional currency. Differences resulting from the translation of financial statements into the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s presentation currency are not taken into consideration.Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through the impact of rate changes on interest-bearing assets and liabilities. These exposures are managed partly by using natural hedges that arise from offsetting interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities, and partly through fixed rate borrowings and the use of derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps. The Group monitors interest rate exposure on a regular basis by currency and business unit, taking into consideration proposed financing and hedging arrangements. The Groupâ\\x80\\x99s guideline is to maintain 40% to 60% of its long-term non-working capital gross borrowings in fixed rate instruments. At 31st December 2020, the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s fixed rate borrowings were 9% on total borrowings, with an average tenor of 0.2 year. At 31st December 2019, the Group had no outstanding fixed rate borrowings. The interest rate profile of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s borrowings after taking into account hedging transactions is set out in note 19.Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will impact cash flows arising from variable rate financial instruments. Borrowings at floating rates therefore expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group manages this risk by entering into interest rate swaps for a maturity of up to three years. Interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rate to fixed rate. Details of interest rate swaps are set out in note 30.Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial asset or liability and derivative financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group manages its fair value interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps which have the economic effect of converting borrowings from fixed rate to floating rate, to maintain the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s fixed rate instruments within the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s guideline.113'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Notes to the Financial Statements38. Financial Risk Management continued Financial risk factors continued (i) Market risk continued Interest rate risk continued At 31st December 2020, if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s profit after tax would have been US$7.7 million (2019: US$9.2 million) higher/lower, and hedging reserves would have been US$2.5 million lower/higher (2019: no change), as a result of fair value changes to cash flow hedges. The sensitivity analysis has been determined assuming that the change in interest rates had occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to the exposure to interest rate risk for both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments in existence at that date. The 100 basis point increase or decrease represents managementâ\\x80\\x99s assessment of a reasonably possible change in those interest rates which have the most impact on the Group, specifically the Hong Kong, United States and Malaysian rates, over the period until the next annual balance sheet date. In the case of effective fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the hedged items caused by interest rate movements balance out in the profit and loss account against changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments. Changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of non-derivative variable-interest financial instruments, the interest payments of which are not designated as hedged items of cash flow hedges against interest rate risks. As a consequence, they are included in the calculation of profit after tax sensitivities. Changes in the market interest rate of financial instruments that were designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge to hedge payment fluctuations resulting from interest rate movements affect the hedging reserves and are therefore taken into consideration in the equity-related sensitivity calculations.(ii) Credit risk The Groupâ\\x80\\x99s credit risk is primarily attributable to deposits with banks and derivative financial instruments with a positive fair value. The Group has credit policies in place and the exposures to these credit risks are monitored on an ongoing basis.The Group manages its deposits with banks and transactions involving derivative financial instruments by monitoring credit ratings and capital adequacy ratios of counterparties, and limiting the aggregate risk to any individual counterparty. The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored. Similarly, transactions involving derivative financial instruments are with banks with sound credit ratings and capital adequacy ratios. In developing countries it may be necessary to deposit money with banks that have a lower credit rating, however, the Group only enters into derivative transactions with counterparties which have credit ratings of at least investment grade. Management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.Sales to customers are made in cash or by major credit cards. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet after deducting any impairment allowance.(iii) Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management includes managing the profile of debt maturities and funding sources, maintaining sufficient cash and ensuring the availability of funding from an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions. The Groupâ\\x80\\x99s ability to fund its existing and prospective debt requirements is managed by maintaining diversified funding sources with adequate committed funding lines from high quality lenders, and by monitoring rolling short-term forecasts of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s cash and gross debt on the basis of expected cash flows. Long-term cash flows are projected to assist with the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s long-term debt financing plans. In addition, the Group has implemented a global liquidity cash pooling scheme, which enables the Group to manage and optimise its working capital funding requirement on a daily basis.114Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020'},\n",

The gearing ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total equity. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and bank balances. Interest cover is calculated as the sum of underlying operating profit, before the deduction of depreciation and impairment charges of right-of-use assets, net of actual lease payments, and share of results of associates and joint ventures, divided by net financing charges excluding interest on lease liabilities. The Group does not have a defined gearing ratio or interest cover benchmark or range.The Group actively and regularly reviews and manages its capital structure to ensure optimal capital structure and shareholder returns, by taking into consideration the future capital requirements of the Group and capital efficiency, prevailing and projected profitability, projected operating cash flows, projected capital expenditures and projected strategic investment opportunities. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, repurchase Company shares, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.Capital management The Groupâ\\x80\\x99s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s ability to continue as a going concern whilst seeking to maximise benefits to shareholders and other stakeholders.

       "  'content': 'Notes to the Financial Statements39. Critical Accounting Estimates and JudgementsEstimates and judgements used in preparing the financial statements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable according to circumstances and conditions available. The existing and potential impacts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have been considered when applying estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the financial statements, including the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s assessment of impairment of assets. Given the uncertainty of the impact of COVID-19, the actual results may differ from these accounting estimates.The estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and income and expenses are discussed below.Acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures The initial accounting on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures involves identifying and determining the fair values to be assigned to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entities. The fair values of tangible assets and right-of-use assets are determined by independent valuers by reference to market prices or present value of expected net cash flows from the assets. Any changes in the assumptions used and estimates made in determining the fair values, and managementâ\\x80\\x99s ability to measure reliably the contingent liabilities of the acquired entity will impact the carrying amount of these assets and liabilities.On initial acquisition or acquisition of further interests in an entity, an assessment of the level of control or influence exercised by the Group is required. For entities where the Group has a shareholding of less than 50%, an assessment of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s level of voting rights, board representation and other indicators of influence is performed to consider whether the Group has de facto control, requiring consolidation of that entity, or significant influence, requiring classification as an associate, or joint control, requiring classification as a joint venture.Leases Liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets arising from leases are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rates implicit in the leases, or if that rate cannot be readily determinable, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate. The Group generally uses the incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.The Group applies the incremental borrowing rate with reference to the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to borrow, over a similar term as that of the lease, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in the country where it is located.Lease payments to be made during the lease term will be included in the measurement of a lease liability. The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any period covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.The Group has the option, under some of its leases to lease the assets for additional terms. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew. That is, the Group considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew. The assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the options impacts the lease terms, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognised.Pension obligations The present value of the pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost/income for pensions include the discount rate. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of pension obligations.120Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020'},\n",

       "  'content': '39. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements continuedPension obligations continued The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligations.Other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions.Impairment of assets The Group tests annually whether goodwill and other assets that have indefinite useful lives suffered any impairment. Other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is determined based on the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use, calculated on the basis of managementâ\\x80\\x99s assumptions and estimates. Changing the key assumptions, including the discount rates or the growth rate assumptions in the cash flow projections, could materially affect the value-in-use calculations.Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.Provision of deferred tax follows the way management expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of the related assets or liabilities, which the management may expect to recover through use, sale or combination of both. Accordingly, deferred tax will be calculated at income tax rate, capital gains tax rate or combination of both.Recognition of deferred tax assets, which principally relate to tax losses, depends on the managementâ\\x80\\x99s expectation of future taxable profit that will be available against which the tax losses can be utilised. The outcome of their actual utilisation may be different.Buying income The Group receives buying income, including supplier incentives, rebates and discounts, which are deducted from cost of sales on an accrual basis. Management is required to make estimates in determining the expected entitlement which has been earned up to the balance sheet date for each relevant supplier contract and the timing of recognition.There is limited estimation involved in recognising income for fixed amounts agreed with suppliers.In 2020, the Group recognised a charge in underlying profit for the reversal of buying income recognised incorrectly in prior years. The Group has assessed the impact of buying income recognised incorrectly in prior years on the consolidated financial statements and determined that the impact was not material to the consolidated financial statements of any prior financial years and therefore did not require a prior year restatement. The amount has been recorded through underlying results.Non-trading items The Group uses underlying business performance in its internal financial reporting to distinguish between the underlying profits and non-trading items. The identification of non-trading items requires judgement by management, but follows the consistent methodology as set out in the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s accounting policies.121'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Independent Auditorsâ\\x80\\x99 ReportWe evaluated managementâ\\x80\\x99s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to the posting of inappropriate journal entries and management bias in accounting estimates and judgements. The Group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the Group engagement team and/or component auditors included:â\\x80¢ Gaining an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Group and the industries in which its businesses operate, and considering the risk of any acts by the Group which may be contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. â\\x80¢ Discussions with management and internal audit, including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulation and fraud; â\\x80¢ Understanding the results of whistleblowing procedures and related investigations. We focused on known and suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement in the Group and company financial statements, including, but were not limited to, the Companies Act 1981 (Bermuda), the Listing Rules, tax legislation, employment regulation, health and safety regulation and equivalent local laws and regulations applicable to significant reporting component teams. â\\x80¢ Review of reporting component auditorsâ\\x80\\x99 work, including any matters reported by component auditorsâ\\x80\\x99 relating to non-compliance with laws and regulations or fraud; â\\x80¢ Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. In particular, in relation to the impairment assessments related to the carrying value of investments in associates and joint ventures, the impairment assessments related to the carrying value of intangible assets, tangible assets and right-of-use assets, and recognition of buying income (see related key audit matters below); â\\x80¢ We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including testing journals, and evaluated whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditorsâ\\x80\\x99 professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.124Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020'},\n",

We have understood and reviewed managementâ\\x80\\x99s impairment assessment process, including what indicators of impairment had been identified and the appropriateness of the valuation model used, including the assessment of the future impact of COVID-19. As we identified a heightened risk of impairment we performed the following procedures.We benchmarked and challenged key assumptions in managementâ\\x80\\x99s valuation model used to determine recoverable amount against market data. This included whether the assumptions of projected cash flows of the business, the long-term growth rate and the discount rate were appropriate, using our knowledge and experience.We tested the discounted cash flow model used in the assessment, checked the accuracy of the calculations, compared historical budgeted performance with actual results and agreed the figures used with the detailed management approved budgets to assess the reasonableness of the cash flows used in the model.Our challenge focused particularly on the discount rate and long-term growth rate used. With the support of our valuations specialists, we compared the discount rates used with the range of typical discount rates used in similar businesses and, considered whether management had incorporated all relevant macro-economic and country-specific factors, as well as those specific to Robinsons Retail, in determining its discount rate.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Key audit matterOverall, we found the amounts recognised in the financial statements in respect of buying income to be supportable.On a sample basis: â\\x80¢ we traced the reconciliation of supplier deductions or payments recognised in the income statement to cash receipts or supplier contracts; â\\x80¢ we selected amounts recognised in debtors and creditors and agreed the amounts to supporting documentation. Where buying income amounts were offset against outstanding amounts payable to suppliers we assessed whether there was a right to offset, based on the contractual terms with suppliers; â\\x80¢ we assessed whether the performance criteria of the items selected had been met and where buying income amounts were estimated, that there was appropriate supporting evidence in determining those estimates; â\\x80¢ we assessed the appropriateness of manual journal entries and adjustments associated with buying income by tracing them to supporting documentation; and â\\x80¢ we assessed supplier dispute logs and managementâ\\x80\\x99s supplier statement reconciliations to determine whether material disputes or disagreements with suppliers existed. Where significant disputes or disagreements existed, we understood the nature of these disputes through discussions with management and obtained documentation to assess whether the amounts recognised by management were reasonable.We gained an understanding of and evaluated the key controls in place within the buying income process and tested those controls in certain components of the business. We performed a detailed analytical review of buying income by type and location to identify whether there were any unusual trends were present.How our audit addressed the key audit matterThe remainder of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s buying income is associated with ad-hoc and promotional income. The nature of this income and the manner in which it is recognised varies depending on the nature of the agreement with the individual supplier. The income is earned as the relevant performance criteria are met. Due to the significant number of transactions and individual agreements and the potential for manual calculations, we focused effort on assessing the appropriateness of amounts recognised. Our focus was on the underlying agreements associated with the income earned, and assessing whether the income recorded was in accordance with those agreements.Ad-hoc and promotional incomeWe assessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to the buying income in the context of IFRS disclosure requirements and consider the disclosures to be appropriate.Volume-based rebates are generally driven by achieving purchase volume targets set with individual suppliers for specific products over a pre-set period of time. In instances where the rebate agreement does not fully coincide with the period-end, the key judgement that we focused on was the estimate of expected purchase volumes in the period covered by the rebate agreement.The level of judgement in each category of buying income is noted below:Buying income is material to the financial statements and given the types of buying income arrangements as well as various performance criteria which differ by suppliers, we identified buying income as a key audit matter.The individual supplier arrangements in place across the Group vary in nature. The majority of buying income is driven by volume-based measures or event-driven schemes, with the remainder being ad-hoc and promotional buying income.The Group has arrangements with suppliers whereby volume-based discounts and incentives, promotional and marketing incentives and various other rebates and discounts are earned in connection with the purchase of goods for resale from those suppliers. As such, the Group recognises a net deduction from cost of sales as a result of amounts receivable from suppliers.Refer to note 36 (Principal Accounting Policies) and note 39 (Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements) to the financial statements.Buying incomeVolume-based income127'},\n",

The impairment charges were calculated based on the terms of rental agreements and the earlier of the remaining lease term or possible exit date.As required by accounting standards, management performed a detailed impairment assessment of the intangible assets, tangible assets and right-of-use assets having identified impairment indicators arising from the financial performance of the Indonesian Grocery Retail business. The determination of the recoverable amount of intangible assets requires significant judgements, particularly managementâ\\x80\\x99s view on key inputs and assumptions made in the cash flow forecasts including long-term growth rates.These costs comprise of US$39 million relating to the impairment of intangible assets and US$64 million for the impairment of tangible assets, impairment of right-of-use assets, redundancy provisions, and other provisions.The Group has recognised asset impairment charges of US$103 million in relation to the Indonesian Grocery Retail business for the year ended 31st December 2020 following a store performance review.Refer to note 39 (Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements), note 8 (Non-trading items), note 9 (Intangible Assets), note 10 (Tangible Assets) and note 11 (Right-of-use Assets) to the financial statements.Impairment of assets in PT HeroKey audit matterWe assessed the key inputs and assumptions used by management in calculating the redundancy and other provisions with reference to actual historical performance and underlying contractual agreements.

This included whether assumptions of projected cash flows of stores, long-term growth rates and discount rates were appropriate taking into account the impact of COVID-19, using our knowledge and experience, for the tangible assets and right-of-use assets under review.We tested the discounted cash flow models used in the assessments, checked the accuracy of the calculations, compared historical budgeted performance with actual results to assess the reasonableness of the cash flows used in the models. We performed an independent sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions and considered a range of alternative outcomes to determine the sensitivity of the valuation models to changes in assumptions.Where the recoverable amount was lower than the carrying amount of the cash generating unit (â\\x80\\x98CGUâ\\x80\\x99), we checked the calculation of the impairment charge recognised.We found that the judgements and estimates made by management to determine the discount rates, long-term growth rates and cash flows used in the valuation models were reasonable.'},\n",

The range of overall materiality allocated across components was US$1.9 million to US$18.0 million.Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.A full scope audit was performed on seven entities including six subsidiaries and one associate, Maximâ\\x80\\x99s. These entities, together with procedures performed on central functions and at the Group level (on the consolidation and other areas of significant judgement), accounted for 89% of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s revenue, 86% of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s profit before tax, and 82% of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s underlying profit before tax. This gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed by members of the Group engagement team or by component auditors from member firms within the PwC Network operating under our instruction. Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those components to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. The Group engagement team was involved in the significant reporting entities in scope for Group reporting during the audit cycle through a combination of meetings and conference calls. Due to the current restrictions on travel and social distancing measures, enacted as a response to COVID-19, the lead Group audit partner and other senior team members were involved throughout the year through the regular use of conference calls and other forms of communication to direct and oversee the audit, including the remote review of the work of component teams.The Groupâ\\x80\\x99s accounting processes are structured around finance functions, which are responsible for their own accounting records and controls, which in turn report financial information to the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s finance function in Hong Kong to enable them to prepare consolidated financial statements.How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industries in which it operates.We set an overall Group materiality level of US$18.5 million (2019: US$19.6 million). This was based upon 5% of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s consolidated three-year average underlying profit before tax for the years ended 31st December 2018, 31st December 2019 and 31st December 2020. In arriving at this judgement we had regard to the fact that underlying profit is an important financial indicator of the Group.Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020'},\n",

Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% of overall materiality, amounting to US$13.8 million.In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors â\\x80\\x93 the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls â\\x80\\x93 and concluded that an amount in the middle of our normal range was appropriate.We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above US$925,000 (2019: US$1.0 million), other than classifications within the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account or Consolidated Balance Sheet, which were only reported above US$18.5 million. We also reported misstatements below this amount that in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.Conclusions relating to going concernOur evaluation of the Directorsâ\\x80\\x99 assessment of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:â\\x80¢ Evaluating the inherent risks to the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s and its businessesâ\\x80\\x99 business models and analysed how those risks might affect the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. â\\x80¢ Considering sensitivities over the level of available financial resources indicated by the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s financial forecasts taking account of reasonably possible, but not unrealistic, adverse effects that could arise from adverse trading conditions as a result of COVID-19 and impact the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s liquidity position over the going concern period.Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directorsâ\\x80\\x99 use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s ability to continue as a going concern.Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.Reporting on other informationThe other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditorsâ\\x80\\x99 report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance thereon.In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

The system of governance it has adopted has been developed over many years by the members of the Jardine Matheson group which both the Group and its stakeholders regard as appropriate to the nature of its business and the long-term strategy it pursues in its Asian markets, and is tailored to the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s size, ownership structure, complexity and breadth of businesses. It enables the Company to benefit from Jardine Mathesonâ\\x80\\x99s strategic guidance and professional expertise, while at the same time ensuring that the independence of the Board is respected and clear operational accountability rests with the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s executive management teams. Having an effective corporate governance framework supports the Board in the delivery of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s strategy and supports long-term sustainable growth.Group StructureJardine Matheson is the ultimate holding company of the Group. The structural relationship between Jardine Matheson group and the Group is considered to be a key element of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s success.

The Companyâ\\x80\\x99s policy is to offer competitive remuneration packages to its senior executives. It is recognised that, due to the nature of the Group and its diverse geographic base, a number of its senior executives are required to be offered international terms and the nature of the remuneration packages is designed to reflect this.

This includes the maintenance of risk registers which detail the emerging and existing risks to the future success of the business and the relevant key controls and mitigating factors which address those risks. These are reviewed on a regular basis.The internal audit function also monitors the approach taken by the business units to risk.

The Code of Conduct requires that all Group companies comply with all laws of general application, all rules and regulations that are industry specific and proper standards of business conduct. The Code of Conduct prohibits the giving or receiving of illicit payments and requires that all managers must be fully aware of their obligations under the Code of Conduct and establish procedures to ensure compliance at all levels within their organisations.The Companyâ\\x80\\x99s policy on commercial conduct underpins the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s internal control process, particularly in the area of compliance. The policy is set out in the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s Code of Conduct.Inclusion and Diversity The Code of Conduct also encourages inclusion and diversity, and requires all employees to be treated fairly, impartially and with dignity and respect. As a multinational Group with a broad range of businesses operating across Asia, the Group believes in promoting equal opportunities in recruiting, developing and rewarding its people regardless of race, gender, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, disability, age or background.

The process by which the Group identifies and manages risk is set out in more detail on page 146 of the Corporate Governance section of this Report. The following are the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company as required to be disclosed pursuant to the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules issued by the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom and are in addition to the matters referred to in the Chairmanâ\\x80\\x99s Statement, the Group Chief Executiveâ\\x80\\x99s Review and other parts of the Annual Report.Economic RiskMost of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s businesses are exposed to the risk of negative developments in global and regional economies and financial markets, either directly or through the impact such developments might have on the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s joint venture partners, associates, franchisors, bankers, suppliers or customers. These developments could include recession, inflation, deflation, currency fluctuations, restrictions in the availability of credit, business failures, or increases in financing costs, oil prices, the cost of raw materials or finished products. Such developments might increase operating costs, reduce revenues, lower asset values or result in some or all of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s businesses being unable to meet their strategic objectives.Commercial Risk and Financial RiskRisks are an integral part of normal commercial activities, and where practicable steps are taken to mitigate them. Risks can be more pronounced when businesses are operating in volatile markets. While the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s regional diversification does help to mitigate some risks, a significant portion of the Group revenues and profits continue to be derived from our operations in Hong Kong.A number of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s businesses make significant investment decisions in respect of developments or projects and these are subject to market risks. This is especially the case where projects are longer-term in nature and take more time to deliver returns.The Groupâ\\x80\\x99s businesses operate in areas that are highly competitive, and failure to compete effectively, whether in terms of price, product specification, technology, property site or levels of service or to adapt to changing consumer behaviours, including new shopping channels and formats, can have an adverse effect on earnings. Significant competitive pressure may also lead to reduced margins.It is essential for the products and services provided by the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s businesses to meet appropriate quality and safety standards and there is an associated risk if they do not, including the risk of damage to brand equity or reputation, which might adversely impact the ability to achieve acceptable revenues and profit margins.While social media presents significant opportunities for the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s businesses to connect with customers and the public, it also creates a whole new set of potential risks for companies to monitor, including damage to brand equity or reputation, which could affect the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s profitability.The steps taken by the Group to manage its exposure to financial risk are set out in the Financial Review on page 49 and note 38 to the financial statements on pages 112 to 119.Concessions, Franchises and Key ContractsA number of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s businesses and projects are reliant on concessions, franchises, management or other key contracts. Cancellation, expiry or termination, or the renegotiation of any such concessions, franchises, management or other key contracts, could have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of certain subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures of the Group.149'},\n",

Changes in such regimes, in relation to matters such as foreign ownership of assets and businesses, exchange controls, licensing, imports, planning controls, emission regulations, tax rules and employment legislation, could have the potential to impact the operations and profitability of the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s businesses.Changes in the political environment, including political or social unrest, in the territories where the Group operates could adversely affect the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s businesses.Terrorism, Pandemic and Natural DisastersThe Groupâ\\x80\\x99s operations are vulnerable to the effects of terrorism, either directly through the impact of an act of terrorism or indirectly through the effect on the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s businesses of generally reduced economic activity in response to the threat, or an actual act, of terrorism.The Groupâ\\x80\\x99s businesses could be impacted by a global or regional pandemic which seriously affects economic activity or the ability of businesses to operate smoothly. In addition, many of the territories in which the Group operates can experience from time to time natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanoes and typhoons.Technology RiskThe Group has invested significantly in and is heavily reliant on its IT infrastructure and systems for the daily operation of its business. Any major disruption to the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s IT systems could have a significant impact on operations. The ability to anticipate and adapt to technology advancements or threats is an additional risk that may also have an impact on the business.Cybersecurity RiskThe Group faces increasing numbers of cyberattacks from groups targeting both individuals and businesses. The privacy and security of customer and corporate information is at risk of being compromised through a breach of our or our suppliersâ\\x80\\x99 IT systems or the unauthorised or inadvertent release of information, resulting in brand damage, impaired competitiveness or regulatory action.

       "  'content': 'MESSAGE FROM THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERJessica Uhl, Chief Financial OfficerEarly in 2021, we set out our Powering Progress strategy, which has four main goals: generating value for our shareholders, achieving net-zero emissions, respecting nature and powering lives and livelihoods. We have set ambitious targets against each of these goals as we work to play a leading role in the energy transition while making a positive contribution to society.In November, we took a further step to simplify Royal Dutch Shell plc and strengthen our competitiveness. We announced plans to establish a single line of shares, and to align the tax residence of Royal Dutch Shell plc with itscountryof incorporation in the UK. This proposal, which has been approved by our shareholders, will allow us to manage our portfolio with greater agility and to accelerate distributions to shareholders, among other benefits.We believe these changes will support the delivery of our strategy, including our focus on being a responsible provider of energy products, while demonstrating our values and principles. These values and principles are reflected in our commitment to safety, to respecting human rights and to paying the right amount of taxes so that we make a meaningful financial contribution to the countries where we operate.As countries seek to rebuild economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the payment of taxes by companies is more important than ever. We support the co-ordinated effort to make the global tax system fairer and the agreement to establish a global minimum corporate tax reached by the G20 leaders, together with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.TRANSPARENCY IN CHALLENGING TIMES One of the ways we can show we are responsible contributors to society is to be transparent about what we do. That is why we are publishing our third Tax Contribution Report, which details thecorporate income taxwe have paid in 99 countries. Each year, we look to expand and improve our report and I hope you find value in these changes.This report covers 2020, a year when the COVID-19 pandemic had a devasting effect on peopleâ\\x80\\x99s health and finances, triggering an economic downturn. The oil industry faced falling demand and the first negative oil price in history.INTRODUCTION OUR APPROACH SPECIAL TOPICS ADVOCACY02OUR BUSINESS SUPPORTING OUR TAX DATA SERVICESShellTax Contribution Report 2020'},\n",

Shell companies still paid $3.4 billion in corporate income tax as some of our companies made a profit in 2020 and/or settled taxes from the previous year. Shell paid a further $3.5 billion in royaltiesto governments. We collected $40.4 billion in excise duties,sales taxesand similar levies on our fuel and other products on behalf of governments. And we made other payments to governments including $7 billion in production entitlements, $1.2 billion in fees and $16 million inbonuses.EXPANDING OUR REPORTS Shell continues to be open about the taxes we pay while looking to provide more insight into the role of tax in our businesses. For example, for this report, we have reviewed our reporting oftax incentives, including exemptions and reliefs. Governments around the world use tax incentives to encourage investment, job creation and to support certain industries. They also use them to drive key policies, such as reducing carbon emissions and protecting the environment.We believe that more transparency around these incentives will lead to greater understanding of what they are intended to achieve and whether they are meeting their goals. We have expanded our reporting of tax incentives as a result, with many examples in this report.We have also continued to review our presence in low- and zero-tax jurisdictions, countries with significantly lower tax rates than the average, against our Responsible Tax Principles. This resulted in our ending some activities in Bermuda and St Lucia. And we will keep assessing whether our presence inlow-tax jurisdictionsis appropriate for our business.WIDER CONTRIBUTION This report includes a breakdown of our total tax contribution in five countries where we have key business activities: the UK, the USA, the Netherlands, Nigeria and India. This goes beyond corporate income tax to include the taxes we pay as an employer, such as social security payments, and the taxes we collect from our employees on behalf of governments.We hope this more detailed look at these five countries provides a clearer picture of our activities and contribution to the countries where we operate. We will extend this approach to other countries if we hear from investors, governments, non- governmental organisations and wider society that it would help them to further understand our contribution.Thank you for your interest in understanding Shell and our approach to tax. We welcome your feedback as we look to provide meaningful and insightful information on the taxes we pay.Jessica Uhl Chief Financial OfficerINTRODUCTION OUR APPROACH SPECIAL TOPICS ADVOCACY03OUR BUSINESS SUPPORTING OUR TAX DATA SERVICESShellTax Contribution Report 2020'},\n",

It does not include withholding taxes collected by Shell on dividends paid to shareholders.For more details, see the chapter onOur tax data.[B] Source: OECD Tax Database (2020), Table II.1.Statutory corporate income tax rate.Our lower ETR for 2020 was the result of asset impairments of $28 billion recorded that year, resulting in an overall tax credit of $5.4 billion.In the past three years, our ETR has been higher than the average corporate income tax rate in OECD countries, partly because many governments apply a higher corporate income tax rate to profits made by oil and gas production activities. In some cases, this tax rate can be more than 80%.Our ETR is a blend of the different statutory tax rates applied to our various businesses and the different tax laws with which we have sought to comply.OUR BUSINESS SUPPORTING OUR TAX DATA SERVICESOureffective tax rate(ETR) is calculated by dividing the tax credit of $5.4 billion by the total loss before taxation of $27 billion, resulting in an ETR of 20.1% for 2020. For comparison, the average corporate income tax rate levied by the 37 countries that were members of the OECD in 2020 was 23.1% [B].In 2020, Shell reported a total loss before tax of $27 billion. Shell companies still paid $3.4 billion [A] in corporate income tax as some of our companies reported a profit in 2020 and/or settled taxes from the previous year. Shell paid a further $3.5 billion in royalties to governments. We also reported a corporate income tax credit of $5.4 billion for 2020.Sometimes a multinational enterprise like Shell facesdouble taxation. This is when two countries seek to tax the same business income, resulting in a company being taxed twice. We believe that profit should only be taxed once, in line with the positions of the United Nations and the OECD.MOST BUSINESSES PAY CORPORATE INCOME TAX WHERE PROFITS ARE MADE Corporate income taxis typically due by law in countries where profits are made. This should correspond to where the business activity occurred. The tax due is determined by the tax system of the country or location where that activity took place. Governments design and apply tax rules to the profits generated in their countries and assess what is owed by businesses. Corporate income tax is payable on profits, not revenues. See the table â\\x80\\x9cSimplified example of application of local tax lawâ\\x80\\x9d for how tax rules are applied to calculate the tax due.Tax systems around the world vary and can be complex. However, the tax systems in places where Shell does business have some basic rules in common.This report details ourcountry-by-country reportdata for 2020, in line with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) standards. It includes the available data for countries and locations in which we have ataxable presence. The data include corporate income tax paid,profit before taxandtangible assets.Governments use tax to raise revenues.Revenueagencies audit and collect these taxes. Most businesses are subject to tax, regardless of whether they aremultinational corporationsor home-office enterprises. Businesses pay direct taxes to the government and they collect indirect taxes on behalf of governments as a supplier of goods or services.In most countries and locations, thecorporate income taxwe pay differs from the accounting tax credit or charge. This is because tax paid can include payments relating to previous years, the current year and future years.ShellTax Contribution Report 2020'},\n",

Governments often design incentives to attract domestic and international investment, which can boost economies, create jobs and develop communities. When available and appropriate, we make use oftax incentivesand exemptions where we have a business activity that qualifies.Some governments may choose to lower specific taxes, like corporate income tax. These are deliberate policy decisions and not unintended tax loopholes. Such incentives are designed by governments to attract investment in areas where development may benefit their countries. When governments offer such incentives, they may expect to raise revenues through other types of taxes, such asemployment taxesor export duties.COMPANIES PAY AND COLLECT A RANGE OF TAXES Companies pay and collect a range of taxes. These include:Corporate income tax:direct tax on profits, after operating costs have been deducted from revenues. Value-added tax (VAT):indirect tax due on the purchase of goods and services, typically as a percentage of the sales price of the item or service. Companies administerVATcollection and payment on behalf of governments. Employment tax:companies routinely collect income taxes on employeesâ\\x80\\x99 salaries and pay these taxes to the government.Excise duty:an indirect tax on manufacturers due at the point of production rather than sale, which generally forms part of the cost of the product. Customs duty:an indirect tax imposed on goods as they either enter or leave a country.Simplified example of application of local tax lawRevenuesCost of operationOUR BUSINESS SUPPORTING SERVICESCost of financing the businessResearch and developmentProfit before tax per the accountsAdjustment to accounting profit based on the application of local tax laws:Additional research & development tax reliefAdditional tax relief for investment in new plant and machineryDenial of deduction for some finance costs (for example perhaps relief is only available up to a certain percentage per year)Profits subject to taxCost arising from equipmentOUR TAX DATA'},\n",

We followOECDrules for these entities.GRI 207 provides best practice reporting guidance and contains many measures that Shell had already adopted. Some elements, such as the country-by-country reporting requirement, concerned information that we published according to OECD guidelines. In ourSustainability Report, we report performance against the GRI standards, including on tax.The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) has developed Sustainability Reporting Guidelines that strive to increase the transparency and accountability of companiesâ\\x80\\x99 economic, environmental, and social performance. The GRI 207 standard, which came into effect on January 1, 2021, supports comprehensive disclosure of country-by-country corporate income tax payments.COMPLIANCE WITH TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVES We constantly review our tax disclosures and engage externally to improve disclosure of data that are meaningful to our stakeholders.If we are still unable to reach an agreement with an authority, we may have to test the legal principle of the tax law concerned through the judicial system. However, we take this approach only when other options have not provided a resolution. For example, in 2016, we challenged a value-added levy on oil extraction imposed by Brazilâ\\x80\\x99s State of Rio de Janeiro because we believed the obligations arising from the law were not legally sustainable. In March 2021, the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled that the levy was unconstitutional.Tax authorities in different countries can hold conflicting views about how the taxation of multinational enterprises should be interpreted or applied. When this lack of clarity occurs within a tax treaty or agreement between countries, we may use a mutual agreement procedure where the authorities aim to resolve the issue between themselves.The countries in which we operate have differing degrees of political, legal and fiscal stability. This exposes us to a wide range of political developments that could result in changes to contractual terms, laws and regulations. We continually monitor geopolitical developments and societal issues relevant to our interests.Sometimes, agreement on tax issues cannot be reached quickly with authorities and we seek to resolve any outstanding issues so that the tax return can be agreed.In the case oftransfer pricing, where there is uncertainty about the appropriate price for a particular intragroup transaction, we may apply for an advance pricing agreement (APA). Under an APA, the taxpayer and tax authority agree the transfer price that will apply before a tax return is submitted.When co-operative compliance arrangements are not available, we may seek to engage with a tax authority to share our understanding of the application of the law.A co-operative compliance arrangement means we engage with tax authorities, providing them with real-time information before filing a tax return. We have co-operative compliance arrangements with the tax authorities in Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, Singapore and the UK. We are exploring possibilities for establishing moreco-operative compliancerelationships in other countries. In 2020, we continued our discussions with senior tax officials in Kazakhstan about a pilot co-operative compliance scheme.DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTY Our aim is to take sustainable tax positions in support of our business investments, which may be of a long-term nature. When we apply tax legislation, we do so with the reasonable expectation that our interpretation will be upheld in court. Sometimes, the law or how to apply it is unclear to taxpayers. In these situations, we may seek to find clarity by talking to thetax authority as part of a co-operative compliance arrangement.In 2020, Shellâ\\x80\\x99s Audit Committee discussed with management new and potential tax legislation developments in various countries and how their potential impact on Shell is being managed. They also discussed updating the approach to tax to make it easier to read, while not changing how we approach tax matters in practice, as well as our proposed responses to the continued demand for greater transparency of tax information.OUR BUSINESS SUPPORTING OUR TAX DATA SERVICESShellTax Contribution Report 2020'},\n",

The core Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics are 21 disclosures which are mapped to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. One of the metrics is for companies to disclose their total tax borne as a core metric.INNOVATION FOR THE FUTURE We continue to improve the quality of our data through the use of technology, including analytical tools that aid testing, assessment and interpretation of data.Tax authorities are increasingly implementing or expanding digital tax platforms, enabling businesses to file real-time tax returns, and are requesting access to our accounting systems. More and more countries are introducing digital VAT regimes that allow for the direct transfer of data from company reporting tools to the tax authorities. In recent years, these regimes were introduced in Spain, Hungary, Poland, Norway, France, Portugal and Luxembourg.We are improving our data management to meet compliance and transparency requirements more efficiently. In 2020, we continued to enhance our â\\x80\\x9cone click tax returnsâ\\x80\\x9d tool in the USA, which analyses transactions subject to excise tax on a real-time basis for accuracy and completeness.

We kept energy supplies flowing and our refuelling stations helped to keep emergency and delivery services on the roads.The unprecedented macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 led to a deterioration in commodity prices during 2020, with significantly weaker demand for oil, gas and other resources.Many governments put in place measures, such as tax incentives, to support businesses and stimulate economies as the pandemic negatively affected companiesâ\\x80\\x99 revenues and jobs. Shell has made use of these tax measures only where appropriate and when aligned with our Responsible Tax Principles.For example, it is common practice in many countries for tax authorities to issue preliminary corporate income tax assessments during the fiscal year, requiring companies to make prepayments. Where possible, we have worked with tax authorities to revise prepaymentestimates for 2020 to account for the economic downturn and the latest estimates of tax due. This cooperation enabled us to pay the right amount of taxes.We have also made use of measures in some countries which allow taxpayers to submit indirect tax returns on a quarterly instead of a monthly basis. This has reduced the workload for our staff and pressure on systems and processes during the COVID-19 pandemic.Shellâ\\x80\\x99s tax team continued to provide the business with the advice and support it needed.

       "  'content': 'CASE STUDYNORWAY FISCAL RESPONSE TO LOW ENERGY PRICES In 2020, Norway introduced temporarytax incentivesfor the petroleum industry as a response to declining energy prices and economic uncertainty, both of which may have reduced planned oil and gas investment. The measures were designed to secure jobs in the oil and gas industry and related services sector. We made use of these government incentives in 2020.In Norway, Shell is subject to an upstream tax rate of 78%. This comprises the statutory corporate income tax of 22% and a special upstream tax rate of 56%. The temporary tax measures include allowing oil and gas companies to deduct the cost of investments made in 2020 and 2021 against the special upstream tax in the year the costs are incurred. Previously, deductions would have been taken over six years.In Norway, there is also an additional 20.8% deduction of investment costs (known as an uplift) taken over four years at the 56% special tax rate. The new measures now allow companies to immediately claim 24% deduction in the year the investment cost occurred for the years 2020 and 2021.The temporary measures will also be available for new projects that have delivered a development plan by the end of 2022 which has been approved by the Ministry of Oil and Energy by the end of 2023. Temporary measures for new projects may only be claimed until the end of the year of the planned start of production.In 2020, Norway introduced temporary tax incentives to secure jobs in the oil and gas industry.INTRODUCTION OUR APPROACH SPECIAL TOPICS ADVOCACY24OUR BUSINESS SUPPORTING OUR TAX DATA SERVICESShellTax Contribution Report 2020'},\n",

There is no common definition of a tax incentive. Shell defines tax incentives as fiscal measures designed by governments to stimulate investment and encourage growth, or a change of behaviour, by providing more favourable tax treatment to certain activities or sectors. In 2020, we decided to use this definition to assess whether a measure offered by a government is a tax incentive. We seek to ensure that tax incentives are transparent and consistent with statutory and regulatory frameworks before deciding whether to make use of them. We only make use of incentives where they are aligned with our business and operational objectives and where we have a qualifying business activity.When we accept tax incentives offered by governments to support investment, employment and economic development, we seek to implement them in the manner intended by the relevant statutory, regulatory or administrative framework.

If we accept any such incentives, we will encourage the relevant authorities to make details of these incentives publicly known.In addition, we will make data available for governments to assess the economic impact of incentives when requested to do so by the relevant authorities. Data requirements vary by country, but might include investments, earnings forecasts or jobs created.Where appropriate, we make use of incentives which are aligned with the goals of ourPowering Progress strategy. Launched in February 2021, this sets out our strategy across our three business pillars: Growth, Transition and Upstream.GROWTH PILLAR Our Growth pillar comprises our Marketing, and Renewables and Energy Solutions (RES), formerly known as New Energies, businesses. Examples of tax incentives available to our Growth pillar include research and development credits and excise and customs dutyrebates for biofuels.The tax rules in most countries were written before the development of renewable energy technologies. Redesigning tax rules to include incentives that encourage the supply of and demand for renewable energy will play an important part in advancing the energy transition. These measures could help make zero-carbon energy more affordable so that it can compete favourably with fossil fuels. For example, some governments offer incentives for investments that will help to reduce emissions in sectors that are hard to decarbonise, like shipping, aviation and road freight.Many of the technologies for renewable power generation are in their infancy and require considerable upfront investment in infrastructure. Incentives encourage this investment and may include tax credits for solar projects or allowing accelerated depreciation for offshore wind turbines. For more on how we advocate for sustainable fuels, see ourBiofuels case study.TRANSITION PILLAR Our Transition pillar comprises our Integrated Gas, and Chemicals and Products businesses. These labour- and capital-intensive businesses typically require long-term investment in equipment and facilities.

This is offered to companies that purchase and process ethane and use it as a petrochemical feedstock to manufacture ethylene. This incentive can be applied if a company meets certain criteria, including capital investment of more than$1 billionand employment of at least 2,500 construction workers.The tax incentive is effective until 2042 to help the state re-establish heavy industry after years of decline.In 2017, Shell began the main construction phase of an ethylene cracker and polyethylene derivatives unit, the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex, that will qualify for the PRM tax credit. During peak construction, the plant employed up to 8,000 construction workers.

Despite advances in technology, exploration risks remain high.Governments use different fiscal tools to offer a competitive upstream tax regime to investors to balance the investment risk and reward, which fluctuate over the main stages of an upstream project: exploration and development, production and decommissioning.Upstream tax regimes usually include favourable tax relief for capital expenditure, such as investment allowances, and the ability to claim the tax benefit of asset depreciation at an accelerated rate. At the end of a projectâ\\x80\\x99s life, decommissioning costs may, in some cases, be offset against the profits of earlier years.

       "  'content': 'LOW-TAX JURISDICTIONSLow-tax jurisdictions, so-called tax havens, are typically considered to mean countries with significantly lower effective tax rates compared with the average rates offered by other countries. In some cases, the corporate income tax rate is zero. Governments have a sovereign right to determine tax matters in their countries and sometimes set low corporate income tax rates to attract investment from outside their borders. In recent years, international organisations, such as the OECD, and many countries have discussed whether a countryâ\\x80\\x99s low-tax policy may have a negative impact on other countries. They have also debated various ways of addressing this. Most recently and steered by the G20, the OECD has been developing proposals for a coordinated two-pillar response. Shell supports such an internationally coordinated approach which avoids problems caused by unilateral actions that can lead to the fragmentation of tax rules. Pillar One aims to align taxes more closely with local market engagement so that a larger portion of profits is taxed in the jurisdiction where sales are made, even if a multinational does not have a physical presence in the jurisdiction of sale. Pillar Two introduces new rules to ensure a minimum level of effective taxation for all profits made by multinationals.Shell has a taxable presence in 99 countries and locations, with different tax regimes and varying corporate income tax rates. When we are present in low-tax jurisdictions, we are there for commercial reasons, such as crude oil trading and retail sites. These reasons can also include the presence of companies that hold investments or perform other services we need such as pensions, finance and insurance. In line with the Shell Responsible Tax Principles, we do not use these locations to avoid tax on activities that take place elsewhere.When we invest in a country, we consider factors which include access to local or regional markets, the stability of the political, regulatory and social environment, local infrastructure and workforce. We also consider the overall costs of operation and the attractiveness and stability of a countryâ\\x80\\x99s fiscal regime. However, the investment must first meet our strategic, business or operational aims.REVIEWING ENTITIES IN LOW-TAX JURISDICTIONS We conducted a review in 2019 and 2020 of Shell-controlled and Shell-operated entities incorporated or present inlow-tax jurisdictionsagainst our Shell Responsible Tax Principles. The review considered the purpose of the entity and whether it should continue to be in that jurisdiction.We identified entities that are no longer active and can be liquidated as a matter of good corporate governance. We also identified entities that can be restructured and held or operated from another jurisdiction. In other cases, our review concluded that the entities could remain in low- or zero-tax jurisdictions because there was a commercial reason for being there.As part of the review, in 2020 we liquidated four legal entities in Bermuda and relocated another two Bermuda entities to the Netherlands. We also reviewed recently acquired entities, such as holding companies in Saint Lucia for upstream and LNG operations in the Caribbean. Following this review, we consolidated the operations and simplified the holding structures. As a result, we identified four Saint Lucian entities for liquidation and completed these liquidations in 2021.In 2020, we also piloted a new assurance control process to transform this review into an annual exercise undertaken by the countrytax manager in each low-tax jurisdiction. This will now form part of the tax control framework from 2021 onwards and will provide ongoing assurance that Group structures in low-tax jurisdictions continue to be there for commercial reasons. The new assurance control process will also identify potential liquidations and restructuring.For example, at the time of our 2020 review, Oman was on the European Union (EU) list of non-co-operative jurisdictions, which is sometimes referred to as the EUtax havenblacklist. Our review concluded that the Shell entities in that country have substantial operational activities, including exploration, production, trading and retail. We therefore considered our presence in Oman to be forcommercial reasonsand appropriate.In this report, we share more detail about low-tax jurisdictions in the country pages.

Biofuels are blended with other fuels such as gasoline and diesel. They can help decarbonise the aviation, marine and heavy-duty road transport sectors. Governments can use instruments like tax incentives to encourage investment in the development and production of biofuels.Most biofuels are produced from agricultural crops, such as corn, sugar cane or vegetable oil. However, there is an opportunity to increase low-carbon biofuels production without increasing land use. With this purpose, we are focusing on using new technologies to produce advanced fuels from alternative feedstocks â\\x80\\x93 such as forestry products and agricultural waste (otherwise known as cellulosic materials, meaning they come from the fibrous walls of a plant structure).Our RaÃ\\xadzen biofuels joint venture with Brazilian energy company Cosan (Shell economic interest 44% with 50% voting rights) began production of second-generation ethanol (E2G) in 2015. This plant produced around 24 million litres in the 12 months to March 2021.Government support is a key driver for the growth of advanced biofuels and we advocate a policy framework that encourages investment. We believe that any new biofuels policies should include:Financial support and targeted incentives for investment in the construction of advanced biofuels facilities. Price support for a limited amount of time. Support could include exemption from fuel excise duties typically applied to traditional fossil fuels. Different and preferential customs tax treatment in cross-border movements of advanced biofuels compared with traditional fossil fuels.

Many of these developments are linked to the energy transition and to economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.For example, the growing electric vehicle market requires governments to consider the most appropriate mechanisms to ensure the fair and sustainable taxation of the sale and use of electric vehicles.Within the EU, one key element of debate is how to consistently apply VAT to electric vehicle charging services across all 27 member states, while also enabling them to meet their pledge to reduce emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. Shell has been an active participant in discussions with the European Commission to agree a harmonised approach to electric vehicle charging that is consistent with the treatment of electricity supply in other contexts.Similarly, both the VAT and excise duty treatment of aviation and marine fuels are under review by the EU. As with theVAT treatment of electric vehicle charging, Shell supports indirect tax policies that promote lower- and zero-carbon transport solutions as long as any tax treatment is consistently applied throughout the EU.Shell supports measures that combat criminal activity. As a global business, we contribute our experience and insight to discussions aimed at strengthening processes and controls.

       "  'content': 'CASE STUDYTAX TREATMENT OF DECOMMISSIONING COSTS IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS Decommissioning is part of the normal life cycle of every oil and gas structure. Safe and responsible decommissioning is a priority for Shell when a facility reaches the end of its life. This includes restoring the surroundings of offshore platforms and facilities in line with relevant legislation, while taking our own environmental standards into account.The decommissioning phase of work is heavily regulated and subject to tax legislation that enables tax relief. The concept of granting tax relief for genuine business expenses is fundamental to regimes that tax profits and is applicable and available to all businesses in all industries with few exceptions. Decommissioning costs in the oil and gas industry are treated consistently as a business expense.At the end of 2020, Shell reported$27.3 billionon its balance sheet for non-current decommissioning and other provisions (see ourAnnual Report and Accounts).Corporate income tax is paid on profits, which for an oil or gas field are calculated as the sum of the income generated by the facility, minus the costs of setting it up, operating it and decommissioning the field at the end of its life.Decommissioning costs are treated differently depending on a countryâ\\x80\\x99s tax regime. For example, in the UK costs can only be deducted once decommissioning starts, whereas in other countries these costs can be deducted annually before the asset is decommissioned. Here we present examples of how tax relief for decommissioning costs is obtained in two different countries:DECOMMISSIONING IN THE UK Our largest decommissioning project is theBrent oil and gas field, which lies in the North Sea between the UK and Norway. Preparation for decommissioning the four Brent platforms â\\x80\\x93 Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta â\\x80\\x93 started in 2006. We decommissioned Brent Delta in 2017 and Brent Bravo in 2019. In 2020, the Brent Alpha topside, the part of the platform that is visible above the sea, and the upper jacket, which supports the topside, were removed and sent for dismantling and recycling onshore.The UK tax regime prescribes that a deduction for decommissioning costs is available only when the cash associated with decommissioning costs has actually been spent. If large sums of cash are spent on decommissioning in a year when insufficient income is generated by the business, this can result in a tax loss for that year. When this occurs, that loss is used to offset historical tax that has been paid in prior years and this results in a tax refund.The taxable profits over the fieldâ\\x80\\x99s lifetime will be the same as if the decommissioning deductions had been taken earlier, before decommissioning. The refunds do not represent any additional subsidy or contribution towards this cost.The UK government has received more thanÂ£20 billion [A]in tax revenues (in todayâ\\x80\\x99s money) from the Brent oil and gas field since it started producing in 1976. In 2020, Shell received aÂ£67.5 million[B] refund in respect of its Brent decommissioning activities. Decommissioning is due to be completed in 2024. Once complete, the total tax refunds Shell will have received are expected to be significantly less than the tax payments made.[A] This is the equivalent of $25.7 billion calculated using yearly average exchange rate for USD/GBP in 2020 of 1 USD = 0.7795 GBP. [B] This is the equivalent of $86.6 million calculated using yearly average exchange rate for USD/GBP in 2020 of 1 USD = 0.7795 GBP.INTRODUCTION OUR APPROACH SPECIAL TOPICS ADVOCACY43OUR BUSINESS SUPPORTING OUR TAX DATA SERVICESShellTax Contribution Report 2020'},\n",

Each individual contract specifies when the fund should be established. Companies are required to make regular contributions to the fund to cover any future decommissioning costs. Contribution amounts are specified in the concession contract or production-sharing agreement. This system allows for companies to spread decommissioning costs over the lifetime of a project.Once companies have paid these contributions into an escrow account, they can tax-deduct them rather than wait years for the actual decommissioning costs to be deductible at the end of a projectâ\\x80\\x99s lifetime.If actual decommissioning costs exceed what is available in the fund, then the rules allow for excess costs to be tax deductible in the year the cash is spent. If the fund accumulates more cash than is spent on decommissioning, then the excess cash is subject to corporate income tax as income at the end of the life of the field.

It includes natural gas exploration and extraction, and the operation of upstream and midstream infrastructure necessary to deliver gas to market.

We focus on new fuels for transport, such as advanced biofuels, hydrogen and charging for battery-electric vehicles; and power, including from natural gas and low-carbon sources such as wind and solar.Natural gas prices, production volumes and operating expenses impact earnings and tax contributions. Global gas demand is estimated to have declined by around 2.4% in 2020, in contrast with the 2.5% annual growth rate observed since the start of the century.

New types of products and supply chains will be established to meet the growing demand for low-emission products. We expect this to change the amount and types of taxes we pay in some countries.For example, we provide liquefied natural gas (LNG) with offsets [A] which uses nature-based carbon credits to offset the full life-cycle emissions associated with the production and use of LNG. Credits are sourced from Shellâ\\x80\\x99s global portfolio of nature- based carbon offset projects. Our cargoes of LNG with offsets span many tax jurisdictions, from the countries where we source our LNG and carbon offsets to the countries where our customers are located. The taxation of LNG with offsets is complex because of the different tax rules in different locations.The revenue from the sale of a cargo of LNG with offsets is assessed for tax when the title passes to the customer. Direct and indirect taxation may vary in some jurisdictions, depending on whether the LNG and the carbon credits are bundled or sold separately.There may be differences in the indirect tax treatment of LNG and carbon credits, depending on the jurisdiction of the seller. In addition, there may be different customs and indirect tax treatments in the customerâ\\x80\\x99s import jurisdiction.Credits used for LNG with offsets are sourced from Shellâ\\x80\\x99s global portfolio of nature-based carbon offset projects.[A] The terms â\\x80\\x9ccarbon offsetâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9ccarbon offset compensationâ\\x80\\x9d indicate that Shell has engaged in a transaction to ensure that an amount of carbon dioxide equivalent to that associated with the production, delivery and usage of the fuel has been removed from the atmosphere through a nature-based process or emissions saved through avoided deforestation.

We have a large portfolio of assets and businesses in different countries and at different stages of the business cycle, from start-up to decommissioning. The business model, the stage in the investment cycle and business performance drive much of our taxes paid.Our business profits are closely linked to oil and gas prices and so are our taxes. When oil prices are higher, we see a greater proportion of profits being taxed at higher upstream tax rates. When oil prices are lower, a lower overall effective tax rate (ETR) might be expected. While average oil and gas industry prices in 2020 were lower than in 2019, Shellâ\\x80\\x99s ETR in 2020 was primarily influenced by asset impairments. Further details on our ETR can be found in theAnnual Report and Accounts 2020.The Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses generate a significant part of our taxation charge. Governments often have specific oil and gas fiscal regimes with tax rates that are higher than those for other industries. Upstream and Integrated Gas projects have phases and our total tax fluctuates depending on the phase of a project.Our contributions to a country are not always included in the corporate income taxes reported. We may have agreed with governments to make payments as a share of the oil and gas we produce, throughroyaltiesor indirect taxes. Details of these payments are included in ourPayments to Governments Report.Downstream includes the business activities for manufacturing and energy production, chemicals, transport and trading, and sales and marketing. These activities are usually taxed at a countryâ\\x80\\x99s standard rate of corporate income tax. Downstream tax contributions are mainly driven by our physical presence in countries where we have refineries, chemical plants and retail sites.In addition to corporate income taxes, we pay import and export duties and other tariffs on our transport and trading activities. Our Retail business handles large volumes of sales transactions, which incur consumption taxes and fuel duties. These are collected and paid to the authorities.Manufacturing and energy production require a significant number of employees working in plants and refineries, raising revenues for governments through employment taxes.Companies in Projects & Technology pay taxes in the countries where they reside. The service fees they charge are typically tax deductible for the recipient as business costs, following local tax principles and rules.Corporate covers the non-operating activities and central functions that support our businesses.

See below for definitions of the key country-by-country reporting terms.Shell uses International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) data and US dollars as the reporting currency in its CbCR. The main data source is the consolidated Group reporting system, but reliance is also placed on data from local accounting systems for specific items.This report shows aggregated country data for entities that are consolidated or proportionally consolidated in the Annual Report and Accounts 2020. We also include data for the Shell share of non-consolidated joint ventures and associates. These data are reported in the country where the entity holding the shares is based.The nature of our business varies and we can have more than one kind of activity wherever we are present. Under OECD rules, CbCR is prepared using aggregated financial data. It is therefore not always possible to draw conclusions about a single entity, business or venture.The OECD developed and implemented CbCR in 2017 and all large multinational enterprises are required to file reports with tax authorities.We share more information about our presence and purpose in each country and location, as well as relevant financial data which help determine Shellâ\\x80\\x99s overall tax and economic contribution.In this report, we disclose ourcountry-by-country report(CbCR) data for 99 countries and locations in which we have ataxable presenceand where we report financial figures. Where CbCR report data are not available for this report, we have provided information from our Payments to Governments Report [A]. Our Payments to Governments Report also discloses other forms of payments. These include production entitlements, royalties, fees and bonus payments. Where made, these payments have been referenced under each applicable country.The financial information taken from our consolidated Group reporting system has been prepared under Shellâ\\x80\\x99s general financial controls. CbCR reports are not subject to an external audit, statement or opinion.ShellTax Contribution Report 2020'},\n",

This also includes withholding tax accrued. It does not include prior-year adjustments, deferred tax or provisions for uncertain tax liabilities.STATED CAPITAL This information is sourced from local statutory accounts and is the amount of money invested in return for shares.The OECD rules require aggregated data, including for stated capital. This means that when a holding company invests in a subsidiary, which then invests in another subsidiary, all within the same country, each of those investments is counted and aggregated.ACCUMULATED EARNINGS Accumulated earnings reflect the profits retained and not used for any other purpose, such as to pay dividends to shareholders.NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES This is the average number of employees in the year, including permanent and temporary staff on long-term contracts.

Corporate income tax was paid for onshore activities but not for offshore activities because of losses incurred in previous years in the offshore concessions. These were carried forward and offset against profits arising in 2020, resulting in no taxable base for offshore activities.Egyptâ\\x80\\x99s statutory corporate income tax rate was 22.5% in 2020 and the corporate income tax rate for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons was 40.55%.

The tax accrued amounts relate to legal entities which were profitable in the year and for which no prior-year losses are available for offset.The difference between the statutory rate and actual taxes accrued/paid is because of the cycle of upstream projects, whereby large capital expenditures in earlier years generate tax deductions in advance of revenue production.

       "  'content': 'DEFINITIONSADVANCE TAX AGREEMENTS These are formal or informal rulings and clearances which tax authorities provide when there are complex transactions, unclear regulations or substantial values involved. These agreements reduce uncertainty and should always be in line with the letter and spirit of the law.APPROPRIATE SUBSTANCE Appropriate substance means that there should be an adequate number of employees, with suitable qualifications to perform their jobs, and appropriate physical presence in the relevant jurisdiction. Many businesses will for good reason outsource some of their activities to third-party service providers but the core income-generating activities would not.ARMâ\\x80\\x99S LENGTH PRINCIPLE This valuation principle is commonly applied to commercial and financial transactions between related companies. It says that transactions should be valued as if they had been carried out between unrelated parties, each acting in their own best interests.ARTIFICIAL ARRANGEMENTS These are transactions or activities which are undertaken without a core commercial purpose.BASE EROSION A countryâ\\x80\\x99s tax base, which is the amount the government can raise in taxes, may be eroded by some companies engaging in profit shifting. As a result of perceived abuses by some, the OECD launched the BEPS project to protect members against base erosion.BEPS The OECD project to tackle artificial base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). The guidance and legislation introduced to support the BEPS project means that companies are taxed â\\x80\\x9cwhere their economic activities take place and value is createdâ\\x80\\x9d.BOE BOE stands for barrel of oil equivalent which is used by energy companies as a way of combining oil and gas and refined products into a single measure.BONUSES Payments for bonuses usually paid upon signing an agreement or a contract, or when a commercial discovery is declared, or production has commenced or production has reached a milestone.BRANCH A branch is an office or business presence in a location other than where the corporate entity is established.CAPITAL PROJECTS These are long-term, capital-intensive investment projects with a purpose to build upon, add to, or improve a capital asset. Capital projects are defined by their relatively large scale and cost, and require considerable planning and resources.CO-OPERATIVE COMPLIANCE This can vary between countries but at its essence means that taxpayers and tax authorities have open and proactive discussions on matters that may impact a taxpayerâ\\x80\\x99s tax return and seek to resolve any areas of interpretation.INTRODUCTION OUR APPROACH SPECIAL TOPICS ADVOCACY147OUR BUSINESS SUPPORTING OUR TAX DATA SERVICESShellTax Contribution Report 2020'},\n",

       "  'content': 'COMMERCIAL REASONS OR COMMERCIAL CONSIDERATIONS Commercial reasons or commercial considerations refer to activities undertaken with a view to making a profit. An entityâ\\x80\\x99s presence in a country should be the result of commercial activities and it should have the appropriate substance to perform those activities. The management and directorships of the operating company should be in the country of operation.CONSUMPTION TAXES A tax due on the purchase of goods and services. Typically, this is a percentage of the sales price of the item or service. It is an indirect tax as it is levied and administered by the retailers or service providers but it is borne or paid by the individual purchasing the item. The companies that charge the tax have to administer the collection and payment on behalf of the government.CORPORATE INCOME TAX This is a direct tax imposed on companiesâ\\x80\\x99 profits. It is sometimes levied at a national level but can also be levied on a state or local basis.COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY REPORTING Country-by-country reporting (CbCR) was introduced for all large multinational enterprises (MNEs) as part of the OECD BEPS project. The report should disclose aggregate data on income, profit, taxes paid and economic activity among tax jurisdictions in which the MNE operates. The report is filed with the main tax authority (typically the tax authority in the country in which the MNE has its head office) which can share it with tax authorities in other countries.COUNTRY Throughout this report, â\\x80\\x9ccountryâ\\x80\\x9d is used as the primary descriptor for a geographical area because that is the word used by the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project in their proposal for country-by-country reporting (CbCR). This is one of the four minimum reporting standards to which over 100 countries have committed, covering the tax residence jurisdictions of nearly all large multinational enterprises (MNEs). In this report â\\x80\\x9ccountryâ\\x80\\x9d may also refer to locations, jurisdictions or territories which have their own tax regimes or discrete rules.CUSTOMS DUTY A tax imposed on goods as they either leave or enter a country. Customs duties are also in addition to other indirect taxes such as excise, VAT or GST. It is therefore possible to have goods which are subject to excise duty, customs duty and VAT.DIVIDEND After payment of costs and taxes, a company may choose to make a dividend payment to its shareholders as a return on their investment in the company. After payments of dividends, any remaining surplus is termed â\\x80\\x98retained earningsâ\\x80\\x99 and is available for reinvestment into the business.DOUBLE TAXATION This arises where the same income is taxed twice by two or more different tax jurisdictions.EFFECTIVE TAX RATE (ETR) This is the ratio of tax compared with the profits in the financial statements. SeeHow businesses are taxedfor an illustration.EITI EITI stands for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. This is a global standard for the good governance of resources like oil and gas. EITI requires disclosure of information such as publication of data showing how much money governments receive from resource extraction.EMPLOYMENT TAXES These are wage taxes and may include social security contributions.INTRODUCTION OUR APPROACH SPECIAL TOPICS ADVOCACY148OUR BUSINESS SUPPORTING OUR TAX DATA SERVICESShellTax Contribution Report 2020'},\n",

       "  'content': 'EXCISE DUTIES This is a tax on manufacturers and is due at the point of production rather than sale. Companies which manufacture products that are subject to excise duties are responsible for reporting and paying these taxes. Excise taxes are in addition to other forms of indirect tax, such as customs duties, VAT or GST, and typically form part of the cost of the product.FEES Fees and other sums paid as consideration for acquiring a licence for gaining access to an area where extractive activities are performed. Administrative government fees that are not specifically related to the extractive sector, or to access to extractive resources, are excluded. Also excluded are payments made in return for services provided by a government.FID Final investment decisionFISCAL POLICY A governmentâ\\x80\\x99s approach to taxes and spending. The policy will vary depending on different electoral parties, governing systems and between countries.GST A goods and services tax (GST) is a value-added tax levied on most goods and services sold for domestic consumption. GST is paid by consumers, but it is remitted to the government by the businesses selling the goods and services.HOLDING COMPANY The principal purpose of this type of company is to hold and manage investments in other companies or joint ventures. Holding companies differ from operating companies, for example they will need less staff but they still have commercial value as a way to manage and administer all the different investments within a group.INDIRECT TAXES Taxes raised on goods and services rather than income and profits. Examples include VAT, sales tax, excise duties, stamp duty, services tax, registration duty and transaction tax.INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Intangible property that is the result of creativity. This can include patents, trademarks, and copyrights.INTERNATIONAL COMPLIANCE ASSURANCE PROGRAMME The International Compliance Assurance Programme (ICAP) is a voluntary programme for a multilateral co-operative risk assessment and assurance process. It is designed to be an efficient, effective and coordinated approach to provide multinational groups willing to engage actively, openly and in a fully transparent manner with increased tax certainty with respect to certain of their activities and transactions.LOW-TAX OR ZERO-TAX RATE JURISDICTION SeeTax Haven.MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISE OR CORPORATION A multinational enterprise (MNE) or multinational corporation is a company or group of companies with business establishments in two or more countries.NON-RECOVERABLE VAT A business can typically reclaim the VAT charged on its purchases against the VAT it charges others on sales that it makes. The government therefore should receive VAT from the end consumer and not at each stage of the supply chain. However, a business may have non-recoverable VAT costs, where offset is not available or permitted.INTRODUCTION OUR APPROACH SPECIAL TOPICS ADVOCACY149OUR BUSINESS SUPPORTING OUR TAX DATA SERVICESShellTax Contribution Report 2020'},\n",

Mineral royalties are payments to governments or other owners for the rights to extract oil and gas resources, typically at a set percentage of revenue less any deductions that may be taken. See Trademark royalties.OUR BUSINESS SUPPORTING OUR TAX DATA SERVICESREVENUE This represents the total income earned by a company. It includes income from customers or other group companies and income received as royalties and interest income.PROFIT SHIFTING This is the term used to describe artificial arrangements whereby companies move profits from one jurisdiction to another jurisdiction in order to minimise tax payments.PROFIT BEFORE TAX These are profits after the deduction of operating costs but before the deduction of tax. This number forms the basis on which we apply local tax laws and then pay corporate income tax.PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS OR CONCESSIONS A production-sharing contract (PSC) is a contractual arrangement between the holders of a resource, typically a countryâ\\x80\\x99s government, and a resource extraction company concerning how much oil or gas each party would receive. The company bears the mineral and financial risk of the initiative. It explores, develops and, if successful, manages production. Costs are recovered through the sales of oil or gas and what is left over is split depending on the terms of the contract.PRODUCTION ENTITLEMENTS This is the host governmentâ\\x80\\x99s share of production. It includes the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s share as a sovereign entity or through its participation as an equity or interest holder in projects within its home country.PREPAYMENT Corporate income tax payment regimes differ. Many tax regimes require payments to be made in instalments. These may be due before the final tax liability is known or agreed.PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT This describes the activities that take place in a country that requires the filing of a tax return and possibly the payment of taxes in that country.

This is the body responsible for administering the tax laws of a particular country or regional or local authority.TAX BORNE Tax that represents a cost to Shell and impacts upon its financial results. This includes Tax Paid (seeIntroduction to country-by- country reporting) as well as non-corporate taxes, such as employer social security contributions.TAX CHARGE The aggregate of current tax and deferred tax included in the determination of profit or loss for the period in our Annual Report and Accounts.TAX COLLECTED Tax that Shell does not directly incur but instead collects from its customers and employees on behalf of governments. This includes indirect taxes such as VAT and GST, as well as employee income tax and social security contributions.TAX HAVEN There are different definitions of the term tax haven but typically this is considered to mean one country offering significantly lower tax rates or other tax features compared with the average rates or features offered by other countries.TAX INCENTIVES There is no common definition of a tax incentive. Shell defines tax incentives as fiscal measures designed by governments to stimulate investment and encourage growth, or a change of behaviour, by providing more favourable tax treatment to some activities or sectors. Incentives can include accelerated tax relief for capital expenditure on infrastructure, exemptions from certain taxes where government economic targets (for example employment targets) are met, or a favourable tax treatment of costs related to research and development activities for certain technologies.TAXABLE PRESENCE SeePermanent establishment.THE B TEAM The B Team is a not-for-profit initiative aimed at ensuring that business becomes a driving force for social, environmental and economic benefit. Shell is a founding member of The B Team Responsible Tax Working Group but is not a member of the overall B Team initiative. Through The B Team, Shell and other companies have been able to give a voice to the companiesâ\\x80\\x99 views in the debate on fair taxation. The B Team Responsible Tax Principles, which Shell has helped to develop, reflect the views of leading companies and civil-society organisations on a responsible approach to tax.TRADE TARIFFS A tax on imports or exports between sovereign states. SeeCustoms duty.TRADEMARK ROYALTIES Payments for the right to use trademarks. Trademarks are a legally registered name, word, symbol or design which identifies the goods or services of a particular business or company.TRANSFER PRICING This refers to the setting of the price for goods and services sold between related entities within a group. Transfer pricing should be based on the armâ\\x80\\x99s length principle. This means that profits are allocated to the countries where the relevant economic activity takes place and cannot be artificially taken somewhere else.INTRODUCTION OUR APPROACH SPECIAL TOPICS ADVOCACY151OUR BUSINESS SUPPORTING OUR TAX DATA SERVICESShellTax Contribution Report 2020'},\n",

       "  'content': 'VAT Value-added tax (VAT) is a specific type of turnover tax levied at each stage in the production and distribution process. Although VAT is ultimately levied on the consumer when they purchase goods or services, liability for VAT is on the supplier of goods or services. VAT normally utilises a system of tax credits to place the ultimate and real burden of the tax on the final consumer and to relieve the intermediaries of any final tax cost. SeeNon-recoverable VAT.WITHHOLDING TAXES A withholding tax is an income tax to be paid to the government by the payer of the income rather than by the recipient of the income. The tax is thus withheld or deducted from the income due to the recipient.

       "  'content': 'Approach to tax Here we explore how our approach applies to our clients and our businesses.We have also historically incorporated companies under the laws of other low tax jurisdictions, particularly the Cayman Islands, because the local company law makes it simple and cost effective to set up and manage companies. All of the profits generated in these companies are subject to corporation tax at a rate at least equal to the UK corporation tax rate.However, we do not market the tax benefits of these locations to our clients. Where a client chooses to invest via these locations, Barclays will only provide the client with services that are compliant with our tax principles.Low tax territories We have business operations in a number of jurisdictions which have low tax rates, principally in the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey, where for many years we have been a significant local employer.Country by country dataNational governments often seek to reduce double taxation by entering into double taxation treaties between one another. These treaties include mechanisms for tax authorities to agree an armâ\\x80\\x99s-length price for a transaction between one another and the taxpayer. These mechanisms can include â\\x80\\x98Mutual Agreement Proceduresâ\\x80\\x99 (MAP) which allow tax authorities in two countries to agree on a mutually acceptable armâ\\x80\\x99s-length price where the taxpayer has been unable to reach an agreement with the tax authorities directly. Treaties may also include a mechanism for tax authorities to agree an armâ\\x80\\x99s-length price on an upfront basis with a taxpayer through â\\x80\\x98Advance Pricing Agreementsâ\\x80\\x99 (APA). Where we are or may be subject to double taxation, we do seek to reach agreement on an appropriate armâ\\x80\\x99s-length price through one of the generally available mechanisms outlined above.The prices applied to our intra-group transactions are representative of the prices that would be paid in respect of transactions between independent parties (also known as â\\x80\\x98armâ\\x80\\x99s-length pricingâ\\x80\\x99). The â\\x80\\x98armâ\\x80\\x99s-length pricesâ\\x80\\x99 that we apply are derived from established and widely accepted international standards such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Transfer Pricing Guidelines, which are applied on a globally consistent basis across all countries in which we operate. We seek to comply with all global and local documentation requirements to support the armâ\\x80\\x99s length prices applied to our intra-group transactions including, for instance, undertaking external economic benchmarking studies of comparable transactions between third parties. Tax authorities may sometimes take a differing view of what an armâ\\x80\\x99s-length price should be for a transaction. This can lead to the same income being taxed in two countries (often referred to as â\\x80\\x98double taxationâ\\x80\\x99).Our approach to transfer pricing in more detail:Approach to taxBarclays PLC home.barclays/annualreportTax contribution10OverviewWhen we invest in our business, we may benefit from tax incentives as intended by national governments, some of which are discussed further on page 11.Accordingly, transactions that artificially transfer profits into a low tax jurisdiction would not be consistent with this approach or our tax principles. A key part of ensuring we pay taxes in the countries where economic value is created is how we price transactions between our group companies, more commonly known as â\\x80\\x98transfer pricingâ\\x80\\x99.Our business Tax influences decisions about how we run and organise our business and about where we base our operations. Making these decisions is an integral part of running a global commercial organisation. When tax is a factor in deciding where or how we do business, the decisions we make are consistent with our tax principles and profits are taxed in the locations in which the economic activity generating them takes place.Conversely, for example, we would not provide non-standard loan funding to a client, where the funding is integral to the clientâ\\x80\\x99s tax planning, if the tax planning does not comply with the spirit, as well as the letter, of the law.Our clients Our tax principles make it very clear that all tax planning for our clients must support genuine commercial activity. While our clients are ultimately responsible for any decisions in relation to their tax affairs, we, like other banks, do provide some tax related products to our clients. These products are well-understood by tax authorities and often deliver tax incentives specifically intended by governments.â\\x80\\x9c We apply armâ\\x80\\x99s-length pricing to our intra-group transactions in accordance with established and widely-accepted international standards.Barclays PLC Country Snapshot 2021'},\n",

In 2021, we officially opened a new â\\x80\\x98state of the artâ\\x80\\x99 campus in Glasgow. The Glasgow campus alongside other new campus developments in Whippany, New Jersey, and Pune, India, are part of our global strategy to create world-class facilities. Our investment in the Glasgow campus is expected to have around 5,000 employees by 2023. Our investment to construct and fit out the new campus with energy-saving plant, machinery and equipment will attract capital allowances, which provide UK tax relief on some types of capital expenditure. Similarly, when we refurbish our existing high street branches throughout the UK, some of that investment may benefit from capital allowances.Where the R&D activities undertaken by Barclays meet the specific requirements of the UKâ\\x80\\x99s R&D tax regime, we are able to benefit from the R&D incentives.Research and development expenditure credit (RDEC) Innovation is at the heart of what we do and how we think at Barclays.

Both our tax principles and tax code of conduct are set out in full on page 9. â\\x96\\xa0 Any tax planning we undertake is subject to rigorous review through internal governance processes before being undertaken. â\\x96\\xa0 Where necessary, we consult with external advisers to help us manage our tax position and to ensure that we are making appropriate decisions.â\\x96\\xa0 Our global governance procedures are discussed more fully on page 12. The same procedures apply to our UK tax affairs. â\\x96\\xa0 We are fully committed to the UK Code of Practice on Taxation for Banks and are fully transparent with HMRC about our governance procedures and how they comply with the Codeâ\\x80\\x99s requirements. â\\x96\\xa0 Under the Senior Accounting Officer regime in the UK, we provide attestations annually to HMRC confirming that we have appropriate accounting arrangements to allow our tax liabilities to be calculated correctly. â\\x96\\xa0 We seek to ensure that our tax filings in the UK reflect full compliance with transfer pricing requirements and the armâ\\x80\\x99s-length principle.â\\x96\\xa0 In the UK, this involves maintaining a professional and constructive relationship with HMRC. We have regular meetings with HMRC to discuss their enquiries and material issues in relation to our tax affairs. This helps focus both our and HMRCâ\\x80\\x99s resources on the most important issues. â\\x96\\xa0 As a large group, we make hundreds of filings to HMRC every year, and aim to make all of these on time. We also aim to make these tax filings as clear as possible and include explanations as required to ensure that our returns are easy to understand. â\\x96\\xa0 Where we face significant uncertainty in relation to the application of tax law, we may seek to agree with HMRC how the tax law should apply. Any agreements have not provided any advantage to us as they have not resulted in any tax treatment that would not be available to other taxpayers. â\\x96\\xa0 In the rare instances that we ultimately need to have recourse to the Courts to resolve tax issues, we continue to interact with HMRC in a constructive and helpful manner.Effective risk managementResponsible approach to tax planningGovernance and controls over UK taxesTransparent and professional dealings with HMRCâ\\x96\\xa0 Given the scale of our business, the broad range of our tax obligations and the complexity of the tax laws that we are required to comply with, uncertainty arises in relation to our tax liabilities from time to time. We refer to this uncertainty as tax risk and it is discussed in detail on page 12. â\\x96\\xa0 Where there is significant uncertainty or complexity in relation to a tax risk, we may seek advice from external experts. This gives us confidence that our tax returns are appropriate. â\\x96\\xa0 We proactively seek to identify, evaluate, manage and monitor UK tax risks to ensure our financial exposure is well understood and is within a level that we consider acceptable. â\\x96\\xa0 Our reputation is very important to us and we take our external stakeholdersâ\\x80\\x99 expectations into account when we make decisions in relation to our tax affairs.We have summarised the way we manage our UK tax affairs below As outlined earlier in this report, we operate in accordance with our tax code of conduct in relation to all of our tax affairs, including our UK tax affairs.Barclays PLC home.barclays/annualreportApproach to tax16Overview Tax contributionThis strategy has been approved by Barclays PLCâ\\x80\\x99s Board Audit Committee.Our approach to the management of UK taxes is fully in line with our overall approach to tax set out in this document.Our UK tax strategyCountry by country dataBarclays PLC Country Snapshot 2021'},\n",

Based solely on that work, we have not identified material misstatements in the other information.Approach to taxWe have identified five fraud risks which were communicated to component audit teams. The nature of these fraud risks is substantially unchanged from the prior year but the allocation of certain fraud risks to components has been updated. The fraud risks we identified are set out below: â\\x96\\xa0 IFRS 9 ECL: Judgmental qualitative adjustments made to the ECL provision; â\\x96\\xa0 Valuations: Risk relating to unobservable pricing inputs used to price level 3 fair value instruments; â\\x96\\xa0 Revenue recognition: Cut-off of the recognition of revenue from investment banking advisory fees; â\\x96\\xa0 Existence and accuracy of unconfirmed over-the- counter bilateral derivatives; and â\\x96\\xa0 The risk of management override of controls, common with all audits under ISAs (UK). Our audit procedures included evaluating the design and implementation and operating effectiveness of relevant internal controls, as well as substantive procedures to address the fraud risks. Other information The directors are responsible for the other information, which comprises both the (i) total tax paid, social security paid, VAT paid, bank levy paid and other taxes paid, which are labelled as â\\x80\\x9cUnauditedâ\\x80\\x9d and set out on pages 20 to 25 of the CBCR Information and (ii) all of the information on pages 1 to 16 of this report. Our opinion on the CBCR Information does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group audit team to component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level.Tax contributionIn this risk assessment we considered the following: â\\x96\\xa0 Our meetings throughout the year with the Group Head of Risk, Group Head of Compliance and Group Head of Legal and reviews of Barclaysâ\\x80\\x99 internal ethics and compliance reporting summaries, including those concerning investigations. â\\x96\\xa0 Enquiries of management, internal audit, and the Board Audit Committee, including obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation, concerning the Groupâ\\x80\\x99s policies and procedures relating to: â\\x80\\x93 detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; and â\\x80\\x93 the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud, including the appropriateness and impact of changes made to these controls to facilitate remote/hybrid working. â\\x96\\xa0 The Groupâ\\x80\\x99s remuneration policies, key drivers for remuneration and bonus levels. â\\x96\\xa0 Discussions among the engagement team regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud. The engagement team includes audit partners and staff who have extensive experience of working with banks, and this experience was relevant to the discussion about where fraud risks may arise. The discussions also involved our own forensic specialists to assist us in identifying fraud risks based on discussions of the circumstances of the Group, including consideration of fraudulent schemes that had arisen in similar sectors and industries. The forensic specialists participated in the initial fraud risk assessment discussions and were consulted throughout the audit where further guidance was deemed necessary.

Over the last decade, we have been consistently ranked as one of the top five largest taxpayers in the UK, in terms of taxes paid. Our principal UK activities include consumer banking and payments operations, as well as a full service, global corporate and investment bank.Various factors mean that the profit we report as being earned in the UK differs from the profits on which we are subject to UK corporation tax. In particular, being a UK-headquartered bank, the profit figure includes dividends received from overseas subsidiaries, which are not taxed in the UK as they have already been taxed in the jurisdiction in which those profits were earned. A large part of our accounting profits reported as earned in the UK in 2021, were made up of dividends received from our overseas subsidiaries, which are not taxable under UK law. In addition, the tax treatment and accounting treatment of various expenses differ, for example Additional Tier 1 coupons and cash contributions to our main UK pension fund.In 2021 we paid corporation tax of Â£56m. The amount of corporation tax we paid was reduced by the utilisation of available brought forward tax losses to offset against current year taxable profits.The US is our main market outside the UK. Our principal US activities include a significant and wide ranging corporate and investment banking business and international consumer cards operations.We are subject to US taxes, including federal, state and local corporate income taxes on profits from those activities. We have for a number of years been utilising tax losses incurred which have now been exhausted in full and therefore substantial cash tax payments were made during the year.Our operations in Luxembourg include treasury activities such as raising financing, collateral management and funding our Barclays International operations, as well as investment banking activities including our equities business. We have also continued to develop our corporate banking business in Luxembourg, which offers our European clients a range of banking products and services, including cash management, debt, foreign exchange and trade finance facilities.While these activities are taxed locally at a rate above the UK corporation tax rate, we paid no corporation tax in Luxembourg in 2021 as our taxable profits were offset by substantial tax losses brought forward from prior years, and also due to dividend income not being taxable under Luxembourg law. We have unused tax losses which are automatically carried forward, and available to offset against future taxable profits.1,0853,3791,2111845,2798585614,6937,576Audited Unaudited Audited Total C orporation Profit/(loss) tax paid/ tax paid/ Turnover before tax (refunded) (refunded) Â£m Â£m Â£m Â£mApproach to taxBarclays PLC home.barclays/annualreportWe also carry on corporate and investment banking activities and provide private banking services in India.

       "  'content': 'OverviewCountry by country dataEmployer payroll taxes paid: These are taxes borne by us, based on government social security policies in each country and, for example, in the UK represent employerâ\\x80\\x99s national insurance contributions. They do not represent income tax on payments to our employees or employeesâ\\x80\\x99 national insurance contributions which are taxes collected but not borne by us. VAT paid: This includes VAT and other consumption taxes (including goods and services tax, consumption tax and US sales and use taxes). The amounts relate to irrecoverable VAT paid. Unlike many other businesses, financial services businesses are only able to reclaim a small proportion of the VAT they incur, making VAT a significant part of our tax contribution. Not all countries have a VAT system which is why there are no entries against some countries within the table. These numbers do not include any VAT charged to customers on Barclaysâ\\x80\\x99 products and services which we collect on behalf of tax authorities.Corporation tax paid: This column records corporation tax actually paid in each country in 2021. Corporation tax payable in any given year is not directly comparable to profits for the same 12-month period. This is because tax on profits is paid across multiple years. In addition, taxable profits are calculated as prescribed by tax law which usually results in differences between accounting and taxable profits. This means it is possible that relatively high corporation tax can be paid when accounting profits are low and vice-versa. The amount of tax paid shown in the financial statements also includes withholding taxes. Withholding taxes comprise the tax charged on dividends or other income received, which is typically paid at the point of distribution from one country to another. We have kept these amounts separate from corporation tax paid by country in the table above.Approach to taxTotal tax paid: This column shows the total tax Barclays actually paid in each country in 2021. The following columns break this total down into its constituent parts. Most of the taxes paid in any given year will not relate directly to the profits earned in that year. For example, bank levy is a tax on how we fund ourselves and is paid regardless of whether or not we make any profit.Profit/(loss) before tax: These numbers are accounting profits. As with the turnover figures, these numbers include some double counting which is reconciled at the bottom of the table. Total intra-group eliminations for the profit/(loss) before tax column are Â£2,840m. In addition, to avoid double counting, profits attributable to dividends received which are sourced from profits generated in the same country are also excluded.Turnover: Turnover gives an indication of the size of our business in each country, and we have ordered the table in descending order. Turnover includes net interest income, net fee and commission income, net trading income, net investment income, net premiums from insurance contracts and net claims and benefits incurred on insurance contracts. Some of the turnover numbers need to be treated with care as technical accounting requirements applicable to the way these figures are prepared mean there is an element of double counting. Profits generated in the US and then paid to the UK as a dividend for example, will be included within both the US and UK figures. Adjustments to address this double counting, called intra-group eliminations, are broken down by type (dividends, recharges, hedging and other) at the end of the table and total Â£5,683m for 2021 in relation to turnover. Additionally, and again to avoid double counting, turnover numbers in each country exclude dividends received which are sourced from profits generated in the same country.Bank levy paid: Bank levy is a tax paid based on the value of certain liabilities on our balance sheet. As with corporation tax, bank levy is paid across multiple years and therefore the tax paid of Â£241m in 2021 should not be expected to equate to the accounting accrual in 2021. Other: Other taxes are the material property taxes that Barclays paid in 2021 and include, for example, taxes on the property we use in our business such as our network of high street branches. Public subsidies received: Includes only direct support from governments such as government grants. Average number of employees: The number of employees has been calculated as the average number of employees, on a monthly full-time equivalent basis, who were permanently employed by Barclays PLC or one of its subsidiaries during the relevant period. An average of the number of full-time equivalent employees at the end of each calendar month has been calculated. Contractors, agency staff, and staff on extended leave, such as maternity leave, are excluded. Intra-group eliminations: These include adjustments that relate principally to transactions between Barclays businesses in different countries which are included within the individual country turnover, but are then eliminated in determining the overall Barclays Group results to avoid double counting. Intra-group eliminations include dividend payments, income from intra-group transfers of assets, and income arising from hedging transactions that occur at a consolidated Barclays Group level rather than an individual entity level.Tax contributionBarclays PLC home.barclays/annualreport25Commentary: We have explained the nature of our activities in each country. That disclosure is included within the commentary column in the table above together with our explanation of any matters of interest.Country: In most cases, we have determined which country to report activity under by looking at the country of tax residence. Where activities are conducted by entities that are not themselves subject to tax (for example certain partnerships), then we have considered other factors such as the location of management and employees, the jurisdiction in which the majority of revenues are generated, and the country of establishment of the entityâ\\x80\\x99s parent company. In these cases, it is possible that tax is paid in a different country to the one where profits, upon which the tax is paid, are reported.The table provides the following information for Barclays in 2021:Note 1 â\\x80\\x93 Basis of preparation The CBCR Information as at and for the year ended 31 December 2021 has been prepared based on the requirements of the Capital Requirements (Country- by-Country Reporting) Regulations 2013 as interpreted by the directors of the Company. The CBCR Information does not constitute the Companyâ\\x80\\x99s statutory accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2021. Statutory accounts for 2020 have been delivered to the registrar of companies, and those for 2021 will be delivered in due course. The auditor has reported on those accounts; their reports were (i) unqualified, (ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their report, and (iii) did not contain a statement under s498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.Country by country dataBarclays PLC Country Snapshot 2021The comparable information for 2020 can be found on our website at home.barclays/sustainability/ esg-resource-hub/reporting-and-disclosures/ country-snapshot'},\n",
